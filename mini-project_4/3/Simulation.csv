I'm a person who should love this game. HOWEVER: DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP. Paradox are scum merchant wanna-be pimps who don't care about making a game good or even coming close to CK2.

DO NOT SUPPORT A NOW TERRIBLE GAME COMPANY WHO ESSENTIALLY TELLS THEIR PLAYERS THIS:

""I want you to pay more for less. I don't want to make a good game. I won't add all the content from CK2 into the game unless you pay me to do the exact same work again, even though I already did all of that work and I am saving and holding back key gameplay mechancis to strategically milk you, the stupid player. I want all your money, and you are a stupid for buying the game, but that's your problem not mine. I wish I didn't have to develop games at all. I have no passion for strategy games, I do, however, like the sound of coins jingling as they come out of your pocket. Have a $15 DLC that changes nothing and is worse than the previous game (the black death one).. you will pay for it because you are stupid. Remember how good CK 2 was? Give me your money and I MIGHT, EVENTUALLY make the game like that...  I don't really care to make a good game or one that is even half of the previous one, but give me the money anyway. It's 3d people, that means you should pay me money. The new graphics are worth something right? Hmmm... I might be on to something here.... How about $15 for a few new models of a flag and a cup which give some flat bonuses (a couple of modders could do this work very easily and would have come up with something far more interesting. With a full team I can't believe that this took more than two-three weeks to actually make [if that even! We are talking flags, cups, and stilted idle animations that barely move at all!)... Did I mention I want your money and I don't want to work at making a game? My day is filled with drinking beer and doing nothing because you give me money to do that. Once my beer money starts running out I might code a half-baked mechanic while i'm hungover... I want your money, and I want to do as little as possible to get that money... give me the money. I want to make very, very, very small changes over time so that I don't have to work hard, then 5 years from now (that would be 9 years since release) the game will be like CK2 and you will have to buy all the DLC!!! MONEY, I LOVE THE MONEY, AND I DON'T LIKE TO WORK FOR IT! I don't want to make a good game, I want to make a game that makes you give me money. I hate my player base and I don't care if my game is worse than the previous version. No, I won't fix it for free, give me money. Buy this game instead of the old one because I will make more money. Did I mention the mechanics are half as deep and some are broken... who cares, give me the money. I added boobs into the game guys, real boobs, nips and all! That's worth some money right. Forget that you could mod that in if you wanted to in CK2 (plus who the hell cares anyway! If you want the pr0n0xxx just watch that for free guys), forget about CK2 and it's fully developed mechanics where each culture plays a lot different. That's actually bad game design because I want your money. If I give you a bad game now, and make you pay money to get even to half of what CK2 was that's good for me! Again, I want your money, I don't want to deliver a good product, but I still want your money. Here, take a DLC that is a broken version of IDENTICAL CONTENT FROM CK2... It's better because it is CK 3 instead of 2. Three is bigger than two, right? MONEY. I LOVE MONEY! I LOVE MONEY! I hate work. Excuse me while I go back to thinking about how I can do as little as possible while still getting you to pay for it, but, in reality I'm just going to go count your money instead... even thinking about the game is too much work. Stop expecting a good game guys, geez, game development is soooo hard... maybe a bit more money would motivate me to make an actual game for you.""

This game is worse than CK2 in almost every single way. There is nothing new here. Even with new DLC added it is HALF THE GAME THAT CK2 was. 

I ask you: WHAT IS THE POINT OF BUYING THIS GAME WHEN CK2 IS CHEAPER AND A BIGGER AND A BETTER GAME? Why buy this crap? Don't support the money-grubbing wanna-be pimps.

DON'T SUPPORT THE SCUM MERCHANTS. Don't buy rotting fish at the market, don't buy a rotting game from a dishonest broker. Save your money. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.",False,english,76561198103349403,230.2,2024-09-25 03:01:39

Sure, 30$ might not mean much when you're american and you can probably spend at least 60$ every month with entertainment expenses, but in the case of most of the third world, the price is not properly adapted to our financial realities, most DLC costs more than 10% of my monthly income.

Ultimate Team is kind of addictive and Squad Battles was my favorite mode since it was introduced. Rush sadly is another online mode, adding to the already never ending list of online modes. Squad Battles was the only decent mode for me.
But it seems EA decided to nerf/kill it by decreasing the Squad Battles weekly games from 32 to 14!!!
I can't personally understand the reasoning behind this.
Why does every FC player need to play online? Do I have to rely on Career mode? Or just Kick-off?

Frost Punk 2 has several significant issues and it is hard for me to recommend the game to anyone who is a major fan of Frost Punk 1.  Overall the game is not bad, and many aspects are actually very good but there are several major pain points the drag the current state of the game down.

[b]Minor contextual spoilers ahead, you have been warned[/b]

[h2]Tutorials (or lack thereof)[/h2]
The story starts with what seems to be the intended tutorial but really the chapter is barely able to be called a tutorial.  This is mainly because the opening chapter only covers a small fraction of the game with the rest of the tutorial tucked away in a purely text/image tutorial window.  This tutorial documentation is actually good and does a decent job of explaining the remaining aspects of the game, but it is so detached from the rest of the game that I would be surprised if most players open it, as is up to the player to break out of the immersion of the game to read the tutorial documentation.  It is completely breaking of the game, and really a failure on 11-bit's part to not integrate the tutorial better.  The sad part is, we known they can integrate a tutorial into the natural flow of the game as that is how Frost Punk 1 worked.  Small pop-ups and events that happen in Frost Punk 1 guide the player and introduce new mechanics in a natural and well defined way, but sadly Frost Punk 2 forgoes all of this, instead condemning the player to break their immersion and spent time reading the tutorial instead of playing the game.

[h2]UI (Why is Everything White?)[/h2]
For a game that is set on largely white background, with largely white features, it is strange that the UI is also largely white or grey.  Generally, it is hard to read the, otherwise very gorgeous and well done UI, because everything just tends to blend into each other.  [spoiler]For instance, frost breaking, the act of breaking up the snow/ice so you can build there, requires the users to select tiles that are marked bright white, from tiles that either grey (already broken) or not as bright white (not accessible tiles).[/spoiler]  I generally am not sure how a visually impaired person is able to play this game as so many elements of the UI just blend in with each other.

The game does come with a dark mode, but the developers decided to throw a warning in that turning on dark mode will result in a lost of UI look and feel.  I guess the devs are trying to warn that dark mode is not the intended way to play, but if that is truly the case then maybe the devs should re-evaluate why they felt the need to include dark mode in the first place.  Additionally, for some reason dark mode does degrade some of the few colored elements in the UI, to monotone colors, which just seems completely unnecessary.  

[h2]Performance (Another New Game, Another Example of Terrible Launch Performance)[/h2]
The game tricks the user into thinking that the game will perform well as the initial half of a play through tends to play very well.  Movement is fluid, clicks are responsive, and saves are not disruptive, but somewhere around the half way point everything starts to fall apart.  

Take saving, the game defaults to auto-saving at regular intervals and, importantly, the game is completely frozen while a save is happening.  At first, this minor inconvenience as the auto-save will freeze the game for a second and is generally not an issue, but as the city grows the time it takes to save also grows.  This ultimately culminates in 30+ second long save times when in the late game (all saves are to SSDs).  This is exasperated by the auto-save feature which makes it very frustrating to be dealing with a crisis in the game and then suddenly everything stops, you can't click on anything, you can't do anything, but look at the ""<saving...>"" window and wait, and wait, and wait....  The save performance completely breaks the immersion, and I ultimately thought about turning off auto-saves because it was so disruptive, but doing so would have made the random crashes much more painful.

What would a game launch be without random, game breaking, crashes, and Frost Punk 2 has them in spades.  I will not go into all the issues the Mac community is having as I do not play on a Mac, but they are many and loud on the discord.  No, instead I will focus on my, and my partners, Windows play through.  There appears to be an issues with the game crashing when playing at max speed, and while I did not encounter many crashes, my partner did and they where to the point that they needed to save frequently (remember the save issue, yea, it is even worst when combined with the crashes).  The only main difference between our two devices, I have an Intel CPU, and my partner has an AMD CPU, so maybe there is an issue with AMD CPUs but I do not know for certain.  All I can say is that the same is completely unstable and you are basically forced to play with auto-immersion-breaking-saving on. 

The bright side, 11-bit has been working on trying to resolve these issues and I am hopeful that the issues will be resolved with patches in the coming days/weeks.

[h2]Frost Punk Soul (Where did it go?)[/h2]
All of the above issues with the game can be resolved with patches and updates over time, but the by far the biggest issue with Frost Punk 2 is the [i]almost[/i] lack of soul.  One of the great things about FP 1 is the decisions a player has to make just in who works where, do the children work in the mines (which they yearn for) or does it fall to an automaton?  These kinda of intimate interactions are completely missing from the game, instead [spoiler]districts pull from a generic pool of workers, are they children? Maybe.  They could also be automatons or the elderly, who knows![/spoiler]  These interactions, and others, are what made FP 1 so great and also so hard, but achievable.  I have hard a lot of players say that FP 2 is so much harder than FP 1 ever was, but I do not feel like that difficulty is truly because the game is harder.  Instead, the game generally feels harder not because it is harder, but because the player has significantly less tools to deal with any given crisis.  [spoiler]Instead, the player is left to building districts and sending out exploration teams, while occasionally throwing some stubborn party a gift/punishment to keep them from trying to tear everything down.[/spoiler]  Ultimately, the only time I felt truly moved or emotional was the very end of the story, which presents the player with an almost deep philosophical dive into the what is means to create a ""utopia"".   This is really the heart of FP 2 issues, the new scale of the game means that the intimate details that made FP 1 great are completely lost, and I am not sure there is a good way that can be fixed without some major redesigns.

[h2]Final Thoughts[/h2]
Generally, FP 2 is a good and unique city builder game, the additional content truly pushes the boundaries and fulfills some wishes of FP 1. Sadly FP 2 is not the gritty [b]survival[/b] city builder that FP 1, and that is why I have a hard time recommending this game anyone other than a purely city builder fan.  I really hope that 11-bit can find away to bring back in some the moral and heart felt soul of FP 1, but until then, FP 2 feel just like a shell of the greatness that is FP 1.",False,english,76561197983564021,14.166666666666666,2024-09-25 05:37:43

I think the problem with this one is the district system and gameplay mechanics makes city planning rather uninteresting. In the first game if something is well planned, you could temporarily at least be ""ahead of the curve"". In this installment, pretty much impossible at harder difficulty levels to have neutral or positive states across most of the supply categories, so you just constantly toggle which you want to get ahead in. Negative states don't feel that impactful. What I would expect is for things to fall apart, except not really. I had negative housing for the a long duration and what I would expect is hundreds to start dying, but it took too long for too little people to die.

Some of the gameplay needs improvement too. E.g.: ""not enough workforce to build building"", but I do have workforce, just not enough. If I have 99% of the necessary workforce for a building, I still want those 99% to do something not just sit around. So workaround is to temporarily turn something to lower efficiency %, use the extra workforce to build new building, then tune new building down to 99% and reallocate the 1% back to original building. Not fun. Old model was better. Queue them all up and if you queue too many that's your problem.

I only put about 60 hours into Frostpunk 1, but I was able to beat all of the campaign missions and DLCs on the 2nd highest difficulty. I became devoted to finally finishing them due to the immersion and difficulty. 

What 1 offered was a deeply immersive city builder where every choice you made, whether that was building something or a contextual event, could have a fairly significant impact on the entire play-through. 

Frostpunk 2 is something else entirely. There's no real connection with your ""citizens"" outside of the ""faction"" representatives. Nothing you do really seems to matter like it did in the first. Now, the overall gameplay is more similar to City Skylines than it is Frostpunk 1.

It's much more large scale, which I personally love, and more difficult to manage. I've found that this is more about managing society than the cold, even though it's still a major part of the game. The Laws that you approve or decline may not align with what certain factions believe in. You may have to negotiate with them to win their favor. All while still keeping the generator alive, and exploring the vast land around you. I'd heavily recommend this game to fans of the first Frostpunk, and anybody who's into city builder/survival type games. 10/10 I LOVE IT!!!!!!!",True,english,76561198335091862,15.616666666666667,2024-09-25 03:21:13

The important thing to understand about these reviews is that the reviewers who wrote them are on the spectrum. As such, they have difficulty coping with change. Their negative reviews are best understood as the Steam equivalent of a shrieking meltdown triggered by Mommy's purchase of an incorrect brand of chicken nuggets.

If you enjoyed the first game, and you are neurotypical and thus are capable of experiencing new things without throwing a tantrum, this game is great. It maintains the delightfully grim tone of the original and brings in an interesting layer of political simulation. The focus is less on exactly how many widgets you have, and more on your citizens' hopes and fears. Come to think of it, the new emphasis on social dynamics may be something else that's provoking misunderstanding and fear among the negative reviewers.

Frostpunk 2 is an ""evolution"" of the original in the truest sense of the word. The question of ""how do a group of stranglers survive the collapse of the word and the oncoming frost?"" have been thoroughly answered by the first the game. The humanity defining conflicts that were so difficult to make every time you made them, are now a common occurrence. Where in the first game you could try your hardest to hold on to what little there was to hold on to of sanity and morals, NOW, after 30 years, those decisions are now monthly, or weekly, or even daily. A group barely surviving the frost, now desires to conqueror it, tired of barely surviving.

I however was pleasantly surprised, after multiple failed attempts I managed to finish the story and what a ride it was. The scale compared to the first game is what hooked me, having a population of over 60K and fighting to keep the city alive near the end was super immersive and I was invested. The music building tension as the city crumbles over warring factions, you as the steward or in my case the Captain battling desperately to hold on just a bit more. But once all the warring is over you can achieve serenity and watch you society function. It is truly an amazing game and I seriously enjoyed this next entry.

You'll see a lot of reviews on here complaining that this diverted too much from what made Frostpunk great and you'll see a lot of people saying that the changes made here go in the wrong direction. I disagree. This game is still VERY Frostpunk: the game throws you into the frostland and you must keep the generator running and supplies coming all while the people of your city bicker and complain about the direction you take the city. The political side of Frostpunk 2 is vastly expanded on; passing laws and pleasing factions are far more important this time around. It is a core fundamental aspect of this sequel to delve into the political landscape of your city and carefully pick and choose which laws are passed and which factions to support. The final chapter of the campaign was so intense I literally can't remember a time where a game like this got me to that level of engagement and immersion. 

You'll learn A LOT about how to progress more successfully with each new city you make, whether it be trying the campaign on harder difficulties or picking different maps in the Utopia mode. I've now gone through three runs each with varying levels of success: the first one being marginally successful just enough to get by, the second one being vastly successful ensuring that my city stands long after I die, and the third crumbling from existence because of my inability to rule it properly. This game's insistence on forcing you to learn is extremely engaging and it really is the key reason why I can see myself putting dozens of more hours into this. 

Exploring the frostland and building resource outposts, surviving the blizzards, and ensuring every faction has their voice heard all make for a gameplay system that constantly keeps you engaged and really never gives you a dull moment. Each new run on a new map presents new challenges and new opportunities. 

While many will be disappointed that this isn't the same as Frostpunk 1, I think the evolution made in this entry still makes it extremely engaging and I have high hopes for the future of this franchise.

It's not a bad game in my eyes, but it lacks a clear vision. I personally don't like the direction the devs went in.

Nothing really matters anymore. Death? It used to make me cringe everytime I'd hear the bell in the first game. Knowing there was a huge problem in my city, knowing that I was losing CRUCIAL workforce. In this game, whenever I hear the death sound I just don't care. People are endless in this game. You can find them all over the frostland, plus you get population growth. 

Also, the main plot? It kinda sucks honestly. At least the ending I got. I pledged to overpower the cold and restore a warm spot. But I didn't even get to see anything cool out of it! All the sacrifice, all the voices I suppressed. And I didn't even get to see like, plants growing or the local climate actually warming! All I did was burn extra fuel for literally nothing in return.

You can't create a ""utopia"" with one vision. Well guess what? It's STUPID. This is not a deep, enriching experience. The first game it certainly felt horrible when you crossed the line, this game it has no emotional impact on me. 

The soundtrack is kinda good, I'd still say the first game is better though. That's how I feel about the whole game honestly. ""Kinda good, but the first one is better.""

I played a Welshman who's name started with G, and who's two loyal soldier camp followers also had names that started with Gs. Notable recruits of ours;
- A starving hedge knight disturbed by all the soldiers without lords who care for them.
- A Rabbi, whom became my best friend and right hand.
- A boy raised by wolves who I inherited as my son.

Then, during year three, I decided to brave a great adventurer; I would travel to Athens and make the Welsh Cockrels heroes among the Byzantines.

Easily the best for CK3, and given some of the other recent DLCs have been very good, that is saying something. 

Maybe a little over-priced, but the fact it launched with all planned features implemented and I couldn't find a single bug in it (so far) suggests they put a lot of genuine work into it, so I don't at all feel ripped off here. The changes are no small changes either, they essentially built an entire second game inside the game!

This has added a dimension to Crusader Kings that it has never had, and makes it possible to play just about anyone in the world. You don't like managing an empire? No worries, just manage your camp!!

Intrigue and Stewardship just became waaaay more useful than previously, and plots are much more involved with their own stories, and it lays the foundation for nomadic and republic systems to be easily added on top of these new systems.

I can just vibe on the steppes as my little band of nomadic raiders now, or be a valiant knight in France rescuing damsels in distress, or support peasant revolts overthrowing tyrannical lords!

I love everything about this. 10/10

You get access to Landless Nobles, which you can develop into several paths: Become a Mercenary Company, a group of travelling scholars, daring explorers or even highwaymen and bandits.

The Administrative Government system of the Byzantine Empire makes it so that your game focuses more on the development of your single estate and successful schemes in the realm.

All of that is packed with new events, new cultural units, traits, and long-requested changes to make regional ethnicities more unique.

Pros:
- Stunning scenes with adaptive lighting, bloom, focus blur, and filters. Combine it with camera work and it's a marvel of game visuals.
- Lots of customization options.
- Calming BGM + satisfying ASMR SFX. Even as you hover over colors to pick, there are singular xylophone sounds playing with each option.
- Highly adaptive procedural adaptations as well as decorative nuances. Bird nests popping up in roof creases and sheeps floating with umbrellas being my cherries-on-top.
- No visible limiting grid, or as they'd say, 'gridless.'
- Very low price compared to what it offers.
- Demo save transfers well into the full game.

Some introductory tutorials in sandbox games can be invasive and interrupting a smooth gameplay, especially if you skip it or will miss something major if you do. This game isn't about that.

You're welcome to explore on your own what this droplet button does, what dragging this wall sideways will do, what will happen if you choose to put three windows together, etc. With the vast customization and options, I find that in my first 3 hours of playing, I keep learning new things non-stop.

You're not spoon-fed with rules, told to run tasks, follow a story, or even taught how to do things - instead, you adapt on your own, just like how the game adapts to what little changes you do. You make the glade feel like home, and the game gladly returns the favor, creating a flourishing mutualistic ecosystem and the humbling sandbox experience that the game is.

Bugs found:
- Certain bugs for item positioning/adaptation. Ex: ivy remains floating in the air from removed/shrunk buildings.
- Camera bugs. Ex: camera got stuck in one zoomed angle, can still move but always returns to the stuck angle. Restarting the game resets it and no progress were lost.

Suggestions for developers to add:

- Options to group objects together
- Controls to lock & unlock objects from moving or changing
- Controls to copy, cut, and paste objects/group of objects
- Options to pick and drop color, also to color multiple objects at once
- Options to enable interactive humans/humanoid characters to inhabit or explore glades the way wild animals do
- Additional water/terrain option: automatic square or circular shape in addition to the manual drawing option
- Additional delete option: wipe the entire scene out of trees, buildings, etc with just one click
- Options to manually add furniture/items for decor aside from automatic procedural adaptations
- Options to generate bridges with different styles (as opposed to people manually making it with building tricks)
- Options to generate stairs with different styles (as opposed to people also manually making it with building tricks)
- Options to generate moving water like rivers or waterfalls.
- Options to generate more terrain items like stones, logs, stumps, as well as more variation of flowers and plants.
- Additional options to change the weather, i.e cloudy, raining, etc
- And ofc more choice for scenes & building styles, perhaps some that captures dark gothic aesthetic or eastern/oriental style designs if that already hasn't been in development (highly suspect it has)

Aside from how well-developed this game already is, I really appreciate how well-loved it is too, both by the players and developers. This seems like a game my past younger self, my current self, and my future elderly self, all would love to play regardless of time and relevance.

This game was a blast and I understand the devs are working hard on the npcs and I hope its worth it, but ive waited over a decade of my life to see semblance of what would change this game forever. They've been dangling this carrot in front of us for over a decade. Its actually wild. At one point npcs were talked about so much that they started muting and banning people over it. I don't blame them. What I do blame them for is how long this has taken. Over a decade really? No transparency until recently. Used to be my favorite devs, now i'm just sad. B42 now to B43, I feel like npcs are never gonna happen. 


Maybe instead of perfecting a decade old game you guys should complete this product and move on to the next with bigger and better ideas. 
Maybe you guys should realize we aren't looking for perfection and looking for more gameplay mechanics to extend the life of this game. 

How about you fix your shit with player feedback?

Or is the code so far gone you are gonna push back the date for eternity or until you tell us its scrapped? 

I'm only saying this out of a place of love for the game you guys have made and as a 
disappointed customer.

Compared to its predecessors, it is much simpler and streamlined and feels much more like playing a physical board game with narrative vignettes than a 4k war strategy game.  Instead of splitting into the dichotomy of kingdom building and war strategy, RTK14 splits the difference.  There are no tactical battles.  The big map is the tactical map.  There is no build up and then strike, you are constantly at war and constantly defending yourself.  The pace is much faster than any other Koei strategy title I've messed with, at the expense of complexity.  But warning, this game is unforgivably difficult and does very little to prepare for it.

The battle mechanics are way worse. They did some weird thing where you can only give an order or series of orders during your turn that plays out in the battle phase. Sounds ok at first, but you'll soon find units sitting around and waiting after destroying an enemy unit while 4 hexes away another enemy army is beating up your ally. It's all based around the AI settings that you put forth, but the AI is too simplistic to be intuitive, or even show some semblance of intelligence.

You'll find everything is based around AI. All you do as a ruler is use excel with a poor UI. Duels? Only watching as two dudes just hit each other. Debates? What's that? Marriage/sworn brothers system, 10,000g for a slight buff in battle and loyalty.  Don't even get me started on their new event system.

There's not room for roleplay or to immerse yourself. Just play ROTK 8, 10, or 11, they are just more in depth and provide more. 

There is no desire for me to develop my generals. They provide you tons of skills to train your generals. But it's just a chore and takes so much time for no benefit. Maybe if I had some sort of attachment to my generals in any shape or form, I would. But it's all just stats.

For Christ's sake, ROTK4 had more depth in it and that was a SNES game on 16 bits. I don't know who they are trying to entertain with this game.",False,english,76561198053796791,51.36666666666667,2024-05-11 17:06:37

We're forced to wait until everyone is back at base before promoting them.

Difficulty Employing Characters Like Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Cai Yan: Despite numerous attempts, we're unable to employ characters like Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Cai Yan. We keep receiving alerts that they're unemployed, yet they continue to reject our offers.

Uninteresting Battle Duels: The battle duels lack excitement. I remember a version of ROTK where duels were engaging, with buttons to press for counters and other actions. Incorporating such features would greatly enhance the gameplay experience.

Lackluster Area/City Government Mechanics: The mechanics for managing area and city governments are dull. It simply involves assigning an officer and then repeatedly sending idle officers out for employment until orders are depleted.

Stagnant Background Music (BGM): The BGM remains unchanged from many versions ago, which contributes to a feeling of stagnation in the game's overall experience.

Much better than my expectation. I played version II long time ago, and recently played Total war 3K and Civ6. This game series is always unique, charming, and has its own style. It brings me back to good old days with some additional feelings from other mentioned games.  

Game play and design is probably the strongest point. I appreciate tons of game mechanics that rarely found from other games in the same genre. The aesthetics, graphics, character designs, and map details are also superb. It can compare to Total war 3K, and I also found many points it is even better.

Even though, it might not be a perfect game (some mechanics or stuffs seems useless e.g. plot/diplomatic or lacking of well UI design which causes too many unnecessary clicks), but it seems to be only small points comparing to its overall quality.

The most realistic parts of this game and series as a whole:
- The look of the aircraft, ordinance, and effects.
- Some of the atmospheric effects: weather, vector trails, vapour, albeit no contrails above FL300ish as of yet.
- The diversity in aircraft types.
- The air battle management dialogue and presentation, which is fairly well depicted for a video game. It's clear that they consulted with real Tactical Air Traffic controllers on some level.
- The depiction of Tactical Data Link in a practical sense, especially with regard to ID classification.
- Playtime WRT length of missions.
- Plot points such as electronic warfare, drones, AI.
The least realistic parts:
- Let's be honest, ammunition load-out storage. Ridiculous. But the missions would be 5 minutes long, force you to land and take off repeatedly, or only have a couple land targets and a single enemy fighter group otherwise.
- Mechanics of fighter jet flight. Totally ridiculous. But fun and arcade-esque.
- Mechanics of air weapon flight. Ridiculous to keep up with the aircraft they are targeting. Fair enough.
- Fidelity of radar, comms, and link coverage. Not realistic for things to just work perfectly everywhere always. Just a game though.
- Plot points such as gigantic aircraft carriers, rail guns, and space elevators. Too expensive in the real world to ever make sense. Alluring as a fantasy depiction for sure.
- Pilot response to the ridiculous acceleration/deceleration and +/-G forces. That is not at all depicted in the series during gameplay. However it is mentioned in cutscenes.
- Supersonic depiction, something that I have only seen accurately depicted in flight simulator.
- It would be cool to have an depiction of Mach, IAS, and TAS if not for pure effect.
- It would be cool to have the cockpit depict information completely much like the VR presentation.

If I missed anything... well you'll see. I highly recommend any game in this series. This is the best seller for a reason but the story is a little more compelling in AC4 and its subsequent releases. Hopefully one day we will get remakes and remasters because these games have a lot of replayability and the older titles are kind of forgotten given their generation. The developers don't have to improve too much to keep fans happy, aside from a better multiplayer experience and some minor touch-ups, such as inaccurate sound effects and a storyline that isn't really very sad.",True,english,76561198155871425,6.183333333333334,2024-09-21 14:21:36
