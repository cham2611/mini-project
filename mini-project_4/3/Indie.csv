HOWEVER, the biggest concern is the servers they have. Right now there's only realistically 4-5 servers running and I hear EU servers arent always up and if you're like me who lives in Australia which needs a Oceania server which doesnt exist then you're looking about 250 ping to play which lags liike crazy on Asia & US server.
Will change to a thumbs up once they've added new servers in hopefully this game continues to grow as I have high hopes for it!

UPDATE: Pretty disappointed at how the management is with this game as they try to do a lot of banning and not to mention banning stream snipers instead of focusing more time on actually trying to open new servers up so to get more exposure for the game.....Right now it's kind of a turn off so decided to uninstall it.

UPDATE 2: The good news is that other servers are up but unfortunately it's leaving players wants to support that are in the Oceania region super dead clearly the devs should be more transparent about this so now they just seem to avoid the question all together........",False,english,76561198107322630,3.6333333333333333,2020-10-26 04:30:10

Pros:
- Stunning scenes with adaptive lighting, bloom, focus blur, and filters. Combine it with camera work and it's a marvel of game visuals.
- Lots of customization options.
- Calming BGM + satisfying ASMR SFX. Even as you hover over colors to pick, there are singular xylophone sounds playing with each option.
- Highly adaptive procedural adaptations as well as decorative nuances. Bird nests popping up in roof creases and sheeps floating with umbrellas being my cherries-on-top.
- No visible limiting grid, or as they'd say, 'gridless.'
- Very low price compared to what it offers.
- Demo save transfers well into the full game.

Some introductory tutorials in sandbox games can be invasive and interrupting a smooth gameplay, especially if you skip it or will miss something major if you do. This game isn't about that.

You're welcome to explore on your own what this droplet button does, what dragging this wall sideways will do, what will happen if you choose to put three windows together, etc. With the vast customization and options, I find that in my first 3 hours of playing, I keep learning new things non-stop.

You're not spoon-fed with rules, told to run tasks, follow a story, or even taught how to do things - instead, you adapt on your own, just like how the game adapts to what little changes you do. You make the glade feel like home, and the game gladly returns the favor, creating a flourishing mutualistic ecosystem and the humbling sandbox experience that the game is.

Bugs found:
- Certain bugs for item positioning/adaptation. Ex: ivy remains floating in the air from removed/shrunk buildings.
- Camera bugs. Ex: camera got stuck in one zoomed angle, can still move but always returns to the stuck angle. Restarting the game resets it and no progress were lost.

Suggestions for developers to add:

- Options to group objects together
- Controls to lock & unlock objects from moving or changing
- Controls to copy, cut, and paste objects/group of objects
- Options to pick and drop color, also to color multiple objects at once
- Options to enable interactive humans/humanoid characters to inhabit or explore glades the way wild animals do
- Additional water/terrain option: automatic square or circular shape in addition to the manual drawing option
- Additional delete option: wipe the entire scene out of trees, buildings, etc with just one click
- Options to manually add furniture/items for decor aside from automatic procedural adaptations
- Options to generate bridges with different styles (as opposed to people manually making it with building tricks)
- Options to generate stairs with different styles (as opposed to people also manually making it with building tricks)
- Options to generate moving water like rivers or waterfalls.
- Options to generate more terrain items like stones, logs, stumps, as well as more variation of flowers and plants.
- Additional options to change the weather, i.e cloudy, raining, etc
- And ofc more choice for scenes & building styles, perhaps some that captures dark gothic aesthetic or eastern/oriental style designs if that already hasn't been in development (highly suspect it has)

Aside from how well-developed this game already is, I really appreciate how well-loved it is too, both by the players and developers. This seems like a game my past younger self, my current self, and my future elderly self, all would love to play regardless of time and relevance.

The charm of the historic cobblestone streets, flower pots in the windows, perfect little gardens in it all. The meadows where the cows pass through, the bells around their necks ring.

I have been waiting for this game to come out for quite some time, the simple relaxing nature of the tiny glade drew me in for a chill gaming experience, I was not disappointed. Its a charming and creative experience for when you don't want a shooter or strategy game. Its a good way to unwind after a long day, something to do when you want to express your creativity, or you just want to escape to your little slice of peaceful bliss. Don't expect to ""win"" or ""lose"" in this game, there is no victory conditions, just build a castle or what once was a castle, build a farm, a town, or a village, its up to your interpretation. I do wish the glade wasn't so... tiny, and I wish you could control, move, and spawn more animals, but its a small nitpick.

Its a game that can take you somewhere new, or back in time, or so it feels. I may not be 7 anymore, I'm an adult with responsibilities, people that depend on me, a day that is filled with more busy time than free time, but for now, I'm just going to forget about all of that, and go back to when life was simpler, at least for 5 more minutes.",True,english,76561198019158913,2.4,2024-09-25 04:09:41

2. A snap grid for windows on houses (So I can make them in line with each other)

Had enough of the team beatup game for a bit? Try the coop pirate mode where you have to fend of a bunch of pirates with your friends or maybe try one of the team game modes like football, hockey or american football. Looking for something different than smashing enemies? Maybe the winter cabin mode is better for you with a bunch of cozy activities and card games.

- Game requires a consistent internet connection, there is no offline mode (yet).
- You can invite a friend along without them having to pay for the game.
- Cosmetics in the game are 99.9% obtainable with in game currencies or through events, exceptions are certain collab skins.

I was always excited for the npc update and I get that somethings were out of their control such as their servers being stolen years ago or it was wiped I cant exactly remember. This game was a blast and I understand the devs are working hard on the npcs and I hope its worth it, but ive waited over a decade of my life to see semblance of what would change this game forever. They've been dangling this carrot in front of us for over a decade. Its actually wild. At one point npcs were talked about so much that they started muting and banning people over it. I don't blame them. What I do blame them for is how long this has taken. Over a decade really? No transparency until recently. Used to be my favorite devs, now i'm just sad. B42 now to B43, I feel like npcs are never gonna happen. 


Maybe instead of perfecting a decade old game you guys should complete this product and move on to the next with bigger and better ideas. 
Maybe you guys should realize we aren't looking for perfection and looking for more gameplay mechanics to extend the life of this game. 

How about you fix your shit with player feedback?

Or is the code so far gone you are gonna push back the date for eternity or until you tell us its scrapped? 

I'm only saying this out of a place of love for the game you guys have made and as a 
disappointed customer.

The blend of FPS action, roguelite progression, and RPG elements creates an addictive game play loop that's hard to put down.

Game play
The moment-to-moment game play is where Gunfire Reborn truly shines. The gun play feels incredibly satisfying, with a vast array of unique and quirky weapons that never fail to impress. From launchers that spew mini black holes to bouncing throwable blades, each new gun discovery is a joy. The tight controls and buttery smooth performance make every firefight a thrilling experience.

Character Variety
One of the game's strongest aspects is its diverse cast of playable characters. Each hero brings their own distinct play style and abilities to the table, allowing for endless experimentation and strategy. Whether you're dual-wielding as Ao Bai or embracing close combat with Qian Sui, there's a play style for everyone.

Progression and Builds
The depth of character progression is staggering. The combination of scrolls, ascension perks, and weapon inscriptions allows for an incredible variety of builds. It's immensely satisfying to craft a monstrously overpowered character through careful selection of upgrades and complementary weapons.

Co-op Fun
I've mostly played for the chaotic fun in co-op. Teaming up with friends or randos to tackle increasingly challenging runs has been a blast!

Room for Improvement
If I had to offer one piece of constructive criticism, it would be that the game can occasionally feel repetitive, especially in the early stages of a run. The first few levels can become a bit of a slog once you've seen them dozens of times. However, this is a minor gripe in an otherwise stellar package.

Gunfire Reborn is a masterclass in the roguelite FPS genre. Its addictive game play loop, deep progression systems, and constant stream of new discoveries have kept me hooked for over 200 hours. If you're a fan of roguelites, FPS games, or just looking for your next gaming obsession, Gunfire Reborn is an absolute must-play.",True,english,76561199114489748,218.5,2024-09-24 18:30:46

Ever since Early access, playing to 100% completion with 400+hrs of play time under my belt, the game has never gotten stale. To say this game has build variety would be an understatement. The game is BRUTAL and unfair but the game consistently adds more and more broken characters, items, skills and weapons that if you can get past the literal paragraph sized text box descriptions and broken English. You'll feel like a god breezing through even the hardest difficulty (Reincarnation mode, broken into different tiers)) just by understanding the many items/skills/weapon/character synergy. Now that Season rewards is a thing, in comes a plethora of new gameplay mechanics, new systems, new skins, new idle animations, emote, frames, new avatars and what makes this so much better than any other game that add season rewards, is that they ALL be earned by just playing the game. Not only that, since premium currency doesn't exist or micro-transaction, if missed out on a season. Pass season rewards can be bought with IN-GAME currency. No worries is needed if you feel like you're missing out. 
There is a bit of everything for people that enjoy that dopamine of seeing big numbers, playing with friends, shutting brain off and shoot things or just genuine enjoy having a google spreadsheet on standby experimenting with different builds.
Honestly, Gunfire Reborn really doesn't get praised enough for its reasonable price point, devs listening to feedback, massive QOL changes, well optimized and bug free-ish (can be played on a potato), game changer systems and monthly-ish quality content. If devs can revert back removal of peer-to-peer connections for multi-player (even that seemed to be resolved as I make this review), lack of body animations and hire a better English translator. Gunfire Reborn will be from a great game to a GOD-tier title. 
Regardless of those setbacks, this is the one rough-like that deserves every penny. Risk of Rain and Borderlands (both handled by Gearbox) devs should take notes. This is how you make a rough-like FPS shooter.

Each character has their own unique in-game upgrade trees, in addition to the overarching meta upgrades you accumulate between runs. There's a lot of different weapons, many of which have their own quirk or special move. I'm a big fan of Daefaning Mortar, a huge energy cannon that can release a close-range burst or an artillery salvo.

Difficulty has its ups and down, with it being possible to stack a lot of damage multipliers and just nuke everything you look at, but conversely it's easy to get killed if you get careless. In co-op you can revive each other, and even in solo play there's the option to add bot teammates. The bots are mostly training wheels, they're practically immortal and will rez you reliably, but they're good for practice or experimenting with wacky builds.

Gotta give the devs credit for handling their new ""seasonal"" updates tastefully. There's no FOMO involved; You can freely swap around between the different season mechanics, and anything you didn't get in its battlepass equivalent is placed into a general store to unlock with the meta currency already in the game.",True,english,76561198040855536,45.96666666666667,2024-09-24 00:40:24

Patience. This game requires you to be patient with its storytelling. The above quote perfectly describes the game with its phenomenal storytelling and visuals. The game devs have carefully crafted the way the story is being presented. The cutscenes might make some players hesitant to continue, but just be patient and keep progressing, the end is worth it.

I myself have no problem sitting back and absorbing the story through cutscenes. The grappling chain arm and game mechanics have good momentum to enjoy the gameplay. I wish that there were some more upgrades or weapons customization but it's still fun and exciting trying to clear the levels.

Saying Sanabi is a Katana Zero clone would be a huge disservice to this game. To me, both are exceptional gems.

But before I continue to sing my praises to this game, what exactly is Sanabi?

Well, in this action platformer game, you play as a retired veteran with a simple mission, which is to hunt an entity called ""Sanabi"". To do this, you will use your chain hook prosthetic arm to get around a city called Mago. This weapon can also be used to hook yourself to the enemies, destroying them in the process.

This grappling hook mechanism means that you will spend most of your time in the air, going from one platform to another, from one enemy to another, from one boss to another. And when done right, it feels oh so good, especially because of the tight movement. Makes you feel unstoppable, and it gets the adrenaline pumping!

I said ""when done right"", because at first, I struggled getting used to the grappling hook gameplay and gamepad controls. Because not only you can hook the enemy, you can boost yourself, slow down time, jump, and so much more. But overtime, I learned to get good and finally experienced that flow state.

Surprisingly, even with this addicting gameplay formula, my favorite part of Sanabi is still the story. Without spoiling anything, you will be confused at first because of the mysteries surrounding Sanabi and Mago are pretty complicated, but once you connect the dots, it will be mind blowing. 

At least mine did, that's for sure. It makes me want to replay the whole game instantly to see all the hints I missed.

Not only mind blowing, Sanabi's story has a lot of heart thanks to its characters. Mind you, Sanabi doesn't have too many characters, since you spend most of your time with a hacker girl named Mari, who's helping you find Sanabi, and her robot companion Mufin.

While Mari might be too talkative to some, I found her character very charming, I really enjoyed her funny personality and antics, and I think the game definitely won't be the same without Mari.

I was too invested in the story of Sanabi, the retired veteran, and Mari. By the end of the game, I was left sobbing my eyes out, heck, I instantly went to write a review, three years after I wrote my previous review.

All of these positive points, combined with the epic soundtracks and the eye catching pixel art, makes the game a complete package worth checking out, even in full price. Scratch that, I insist YOU to try out this game if you love some fast paced action gameplay and heart tugging storytelling.

The story, the artstyle, the game mechanics, the world-building, and the soundtrack are all top notch. It does however get really tedious at times. It's clearly heavily inspired by Katana Zero, but where Katana Zero effortlessly succeeds in integrating an intriguing plotline with its fast-paced gameplay. This one fails; miserably at times. It felt like the cutscenes and gameplay were constantly interrupting each other, the second you get into the gameplay and are being thrown challenging enemies, you're interrupted by a cutscene twice as long, and when the story gets interesting, you're interrupted with the gameplay. At some point it was hard to enjoy the game cause there was this constant anticipation that the gameplay would come to a grinding halt with a dense cutscene.
I played the speedrun after completing the campaign, and playing it felt leagues better than story mode, the gameplay felt more connected and fluid.
The story is definitely worth experiencing but I don't think it warrants the awful gameplay to cutscene ratio. A lot of it could have been condensed, some of it could have been shown in collectables or records people who are interested could go out of their way to find, having cutscenes between longer sequences of gameplay, etc.

It's good but it would've felt so much better had it put its fast-paced gameplay front and centre, and it seems they could've easily done that.",True,english,76561198303990922,17.666666666666668,2024-09-20 06:59:45

This is a very good game, but it is certainly not a game that deserves an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" tag.  Here's why:

(1) The best part of this game is the story; there is little doubt about that. Though the story is very good, it is absolutely not original, as it is basically an exact copy of a couple very specific movies. Still, the story is worth getting through. I suggest you don't read anything about it and just go through it without any spoilers of any type, even the trailers.

(2) The problem with this ""game"" is that there is too much emphasis on the story.  You will spend significantly more time watching cut scenes and reading dialogue than actually playing.  That sounds like an exaggeration, but it is 100% true. There is LESS TIME SPENT ON GAMEPLAY THAN ON CUT SCENES. 

(3) The game took some obvious inspiration from Bionic Commando.  Swinging around is fun, but that is basically all you do.  There is little combat here and it is as simplistic as you can possibly get while still calling this a game. 

(4) It way too easy. The challenge of the game is figuring out and becoming adept with the controls.  Once you do that, you fly through the game with ease. 

Some of the reviews compare this to Katana Zero, even saying that it is better than Katana Zero.  I don't think this game is playing in the same league as Katana Zero.  Katana Zero is a far superior game. 

This could have been a legitimate classic if there was more time spent on gameplay and less on cut scenes. This game is a B.  I am not suggesting that you should not play it, as it has its fun parts, but this is really more a movie than a video game.",True,english,76561198027895986,11.7,2024-09-14 16:48:15
