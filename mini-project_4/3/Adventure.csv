Not too familiar with it personally, so it was a nice breath of fresh air. 

The combat is fun and there's a lot of build variety. Sometimes the controls can feel a bit janky (feels like commands aren't queued up properly if your character is busy in an animation so it feels like you have to spam buttons to get one command out sometimes).

The story was relatively interesting. The end chapter animations were a huge highlight and a wonderful little decompression moment after the (usually) intense chapter end bosses.

Areas looked very beautiful but I definitely felt like level design itself was a bit lacking (even if the environments were gorgeous). Some areas dragged on for far too long and were kind of samey (chapter 5 really felt like it would never end). 

Overall, I definitely enjoyed the game and felt like the time I spent with it was worth it. I'm looking forward to the DLC.

Every new DLC character release is like a recreation of the Stanford Prison Experiment.  Half the players switch to the new character and get to be wardens, and half the players stick with their main character and get to be prisoners.

Having to fight a constant loop of Terry, Bison, and Akuma is not fun any more.   The only successful DLC characters were Ed and Aki.  They were different enough to attract some attention, but not so overpowered that everyone switched to them.  The pattern with Akuma, Bison, and now Terry is clear.

Pros
-feels like a older game in the gameplay sense, feels like the original gears of war games or halo
-After 100 hours im still looking foward to playing more
-Day 1 gave us a road map detailing the next year of content new maps for pve and pvp, new modes for pvp and pve, new enemies in pve, new weapons and more
-PvP is incredibly fun and isnt a grind fest to jump into the fun, hop in do some pvp, go back to pve no problem
- Gameplay as a whole is the best part of the game, its never been more fun to hop in and kill some heretics or some nids with a fury that would make the God Emperor of Mankind proud
-perk system is not overly complicated
-HIGH SKILL CEILING on higher difficulties when it comes to keeping your health afloat so long as your not using a melta weapon in which case the game is easy mode

cons

-issues with servers right now
-weapon balance needs to be fixed (bolt weapons need a fix for pve)
-certain enemies on ruthless difficulty feel way too meat spongy
-some extremis enemies will sometimes never die regardless of damage dealt sometimes which can kill runs on higher difficulties
-need more maps but they are otw",True,english,76561198141728573,99.5,2024-09-25 05:13:29

But it has come back and came back stronger with more presences  that I'm happy more gamers and big mains-streamers/youtubers are getting into 40k more than ever of any 40k games i've known for these past 20 years since i got into the franchise, and i gotten into the series since dawn of war 1 rts style.

Some annoying things i will say about Space marine 2 compared to 1 is just lack of heal options outside of 2 stim LIMIT YOU RARELY FIND WHEN YOU NEED IT, as they ""changed"" away health regeneration off of iconic ""execution"" and only apply it to your ""Armor"" (totally not shield mechanic) but the armor recharge gauge requires you to be not in combat or danger for FIFTEENTH WHOLE SECONDS.  Still doesn't sound that bad? if it wasn't SO ANNOYING while cutting mobs up, while range enemies OUT DPS the time im MELEEING TANKY ENEMIES INTO EXECUTION STATE.

I am a huge fan of the 2018 GoW, and this game actually improves on it in nearly every way. I wish that I could be writing a positive review right now, because this game absolutely deserves it... on console.

I bought the steam port the second it came out, and ever since, it has been fundamentally broken. I have no idea why most other reviewers aren't commenting on this, but this port is unplayable as it stands. I can repeatedly cause it to crash to desktop simply by looking at the in-game menus. If you want to read the in game lore, the game will crash the second you select any other item than the one it initially opened on, eg. Kvasir's Poems. The game also crashes during certain fights seemingly at random. And all of this will occur after closing the game and reopening to play later from your last save, which is a very normal thing to do.

I am running the game on an asus zephyrus laptop, with a 3080 gpu, as well as 8gb of vram. I am well within the bounds of recommended specs, and run intensive games all the time with no problems whatsoever. I have tried almost every combination of settings, both in and out of the game, but to no avail. I have scoured what little there is online, and amazingly, turning it off and on again doesn't fix an in-game bug, or bugs.

I have to imagine that all the good reviews are from people who haven't picked up this game since the first time opening it, or who have only played it on console. When this bug, or bugs, is fixed, I will immediately come back and edit this review to be glowing. But in the meantime, I encourage everyone to stay far away until it is fixed, and play the console version instead.",False,english,76561198182899495,12.533333333333333,2024-09-25 04:44:06

People may complain about the Ironwood section and while it was the weakest part of the game, it was still an enjoyable experience.

I have gotten to the mission with Atreus and [spoiler]Angrboda[/spoiler] and I have to take a break from this game as this mission in particular is a pungent combination of every aspect that makes this game so awful...

[*] The game features an Incredibly drawn out level design that forcefully diverts attention from the main objective without creating any sort of interest in whatever else that's going on. 
[*] The dialogue/voice acting takes away from the immersion of the mission and rarely adds anything of substance to the world (Sindri, Brock, and a few others are exceptions to this). 
[*] The combat system feels inconsistent and fights including bosses feel less ""cool"" then in the other games. 
[*] The puzzles/path discovery needed to advance within missions feels redundant, unoriginal, and often times unnecessary. 
[*] And IMO the armor/weapon upgrade UI feels unrefined and outdated. 

These issues are dramatically present in the mission mentioned above but are featured throughout the ~9 hours of gameplay I've experienced so far.

On the plus side the graphics and cut scenes look amazing, and the main story so far is awesome, in spite of how hard the developers tried to destroy the interesting aspects of the story through an incredibly poorly thought out gameplay experience. 

IMO this game is nowhere near worth the $60 price tag and I heavily regret spending that amount on this game. I would seriously wait for it to go on sale somewhere below the $30 mark. 

I will most likely end up completing the main story, just for nostalgias sake, and immediately uninstall it.",False,english,76561198106538476,8.566666666666666,2024-09-24 21:49:59

It's very slow moving story wise with loads of places where you can only move your character around slowly in game. I usually love games with loads of interaction between characters but so much of the dialogue is bad and dull that this is one of the few games where I want to skip scenes. Worst of all for me though is that there are permanently missable items, such as a materia at the start of the game that you can never get again if you miss it. That's just bad design.

Combat is fine. There is an option for letting your guys auto attack so you can focus on commands but if you do that battles take soooooooo long whereas they go fast if you just mash x. I can see what they were trying to do and it looks cool to watch but playing it feels unfocused and you because everything is in such frenetic action, you can't appreciate the art assets or models at all

You need to adopt that they added some side arcs and more depth to the characters that hadn't been there in the beginning but if you're an open minded person this add so much value to the story. I didn't think after all that critizism that I'd say that, but I love the changes and love even more to see that 95% stayed the same. Awesome!

Beyond well optimized. Its easily one of my favorite games to play right now.

Aside from running well, this game has been everything I wanted it to be and then some. Compared to the vibe of original FF7, I think this does it a lot of justice. The characters and dialogue are fun, the Shinra menace is equally pronounced etc.

The combat is so smooth I don't even know where to start. But somehow they made a turn-based FF game feel completely naturally FF in an action RPG environment. It's great.

The pacing is good, the side quests are cute and rewarding. I feel like I wasn't wasting much time if any in this game. Everything just sorta flows when you figure out the map.

I can praise this game all day. I'm on the last chapter as of today - I only have a few issues:

-The humor can be out of place sometimes along with the fan service. Particularly when you hear Tifa say 'Man I really need a shower' for the 40th time after a fight it sorta makes you raise an eyebrow, genuinely. That crap is NOT why I'm here and it's sad to me that these adults designing these games find it adds anything to this kinda game.

-I get there is world building and the game GENUINELY at times feels like a re-imagined PS1 game but at times I feel like I'm running down long hallways for no real reason. Are the narrow passages you have to side-step through like...loading screens? Some places are just too big dude. 

-Collect-a-thon. As much as I like that and enjoy it in FF games, this game goes a little too far with the ground clutter. Way too many boxes to destroy. Personally I prefer ~80% of my items to be bought/earned from fights but I'd reckon 70-80% of your important items are in yellow-lit boxes and the battle rewards are mostly for gil. Is what it is. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I would probably enjoy *an hour or 2* Less destroying boxes on the ground.",True,english,76561197995229830,39.11666666666667,2024-09-22 20:25:37

There are pros and cons for someone like myself. I love the graphics and how they've been redone. I love the voices given to the characters. I love how interactive the game is, and it doesn't have to cut to a ""movie"" scene as in previous Final Fantasy games. I don't mind the slight change in the leveling/batting system. It feels more fluid, yet I can access the menu to choose what I want to do for the character I'm controlling. Is it complete control over all the characters with ATB? No. However, for this remake, it feels right. Moving onto changes in the story. There are a lot I agree with, and it was nice to have a change. However, I also felt a lot didn't need a change. That is my opinion, and you must make up your own. It's still a fantastic game, and I love it.",True,english,76561198933387046,41.65,2024-09-22 08:09:28

- Combat gets interruped every five second because camera gotta zoom on enemy charging attack.
- Knockbacks are insane every time you get close they knock you back and they can lead to combos just becouse.
- Even if you manage to hit enemy they just automatically counter deal damage to you and send you away again.
- Party members are awful they do just bare minimum, they live long enough just becouse enemy mostly targets only character currenty controlled by player.(Also same useless character blows in next cinematic fifty ton boulder with lightning. That just makes me scream.)
- Dodge got no i frames it only avoids aoe and projectiles in melee vs bosses is pretty much useless.
- Attacks cannot be cancelled probably biggest turnback issue i have no idea why but we can only watch next three seconds getting hit and have no other option.
- I did it in second try and the WORST thing is i dont even know how..
