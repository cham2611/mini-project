HOWEVER, the biggest concern is the servers they have. Right now there's only realistically 4-5 servers running and I hear EU servers arent always up and if you're like me who lives in Australia which needs a Oceania server which doesnt exist then you're looking about 250 ping to play which lags liike crazy on Asia & US server.
Will change to a thumbs up once they've added new servers in hopefully this game continues to grow as I have high hopes for it!

UPDATE: Pretty disappointed at how the management is with this game as they try to do a lot of banning and not to mention banning stream snipers instead of focusing more time on actually trying to open new servers up so to get more exposure for the game.....Right now it's kind of a turn off so decided to uninstall it.

I'm a person who should love this game. HOWEVER: DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP. Paradox are scum merchant wanna-be pimps who don't care about making a game good or even coming close to CK2.

DO NOT SUPPORT A NOW TERRIBLE GAME COMPANY WHO ESSENTIALLY TELLS THEIR PLAYERS THIS:

""I want you to pay more for less. I don't want to make a good game. I won't add all the content from CK2 into the game unless you pay me to do the exact same work again, even though I already did all of that work and I am saving and holding back key gameplay mechancis to strategically milk you, the stupid player. I want all your money, and you are a stupid for buying the game, but that's your problem not mine. I wish I didn't have to develop games at all. I have no passion for strategy games, I do, however, like the sound of coins jingling as they come out of your pocket. Have a $15 DLC that changes nothing and is worse than the previous game (the black death one).. you will pay for it because you are stupid. Remember how good CK 2 was? Give me your money and I MIGHT, EVENTUALLY make the game like that...  I don't really care to make a good game or one that is even half of the previous one, but give me the money anyway. It's 3d people, that means you should pay me money. The new graphics are worth something right? Hmmm... I might be on to something here.... How about $15 for a few new models of a flag and a cup which give some flat bonuses (a couple of modders could do this work very easily and would have come up with something far more interesting. With a full team I can't believe that this took more than two-three weeks to actually make [if that even! We are talking flags, cups, and stilted idle animations that barely move at all!)... Did I mention I want your money and I don't want to work at making a game? My day is filled with drinking beer and doing nothing because you give me money to do that. Once my beer money starts running out I might code a half-baked mechanic while i'm hungover... I want your money, and I want to do as little as possible to get that money... give me the money. I want to make very, very, very small changes over time so that I don't have to work hard, then 5 years from now (that would be 9 years since release) the game will be like CK2 and you will have to buy all the DLC!!! MONEY, I LOVE THE MONEY, AND I DON'T LIKE TO WORK FOR IT! I don't want to make a good game, I want to make a game that makes you give me money. I hate my player base and I don't care if my game is worse than the previous version. No, I won't fix it for free, give me money. Buy this game instead of the old one because I will make more money. Did I mention the mechanics are half as deep and some are broken... who cares, give me the money. I added boobs into the game guys, real boobs, nips and all! That's worth some money right. Forget that you could mod that in if you wanted to in CK2 (plus who the hell cares anyway! If you want the pr0n0xxx just watch that for free guys), forget about CK2 and it's fully developed mechanics where each culture plays a lot different. That's actually bad game design because I want your money. If I give you a bad game now, and make you pay money to get even to half of what CK2 was that's good for me! Again, I want your money, I don't want to deliver a good product, but I still want your money. Here, take a DLC that is a broken version of IDENTICAL CONTENT FROM CK2... It's better because it is CK 3 instead of 2. Three is bigger than two, right? MONEY. I LOVE MONEY! I LOVE MONEY! I hate work. Excuse me while I go back to thinking about how I can do as little as possible while still getting you to pay for it, but, in reality I'm just going to go count your money instead... even thinking about the game is too much work. Stop expecting a good game guys, geez, game development is soooo hard... maybe a bit more money would motivate me to make an actual game for you.""

This game is worse than CK2 in almost every single way. There is nothing new here. Even with new DLC added it is HALF THE GAME THAT CK2 was. 

I ask you: WHAT IS THE POINT OF BUYING THIS GAME WHEN CK2 IS CHEAPER AND A BIGGER AND A BETTER GAME? Why buy this crap? Don't support the money-grubbing wanna-be pimps.

DON'T SUPPORT THE SCUM MERCHANTS. Don't buy rotting fish at the market, don't buy a rotting game from a dishonest broker. Save your money. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.",False,english,76561198103349403,230.2,2024-09-25 03:01:39

Frost Punk 2 has several significant issues and it is hard for me to recommend the game to anyone who is a major fan of Frost Punk 1.  Overall the game is not bad, and many aspects are actually very good but there are several major pain points the drag the current state of the game down.

[b]Minor contextual spoilers ahead, you have been warned[/b]

[h2]Tutorials (or lack thereof)[/h2]
The story starts with what seems to be the intended tutorial but really the chapter is barely able to be called a tutorial.  This is mainly because the opening chapter only covers a small fraction of the game with the rest of the tutorial tucked away in a purely text/image tutorial window.  This tutorial documentation is actually good and does a decent job of explaining the remaining aspects of the game, but it is so detached from the rest of the game that I would be surprised if most players open it, as is up to the player to break out of the immersion of the game to read the tutorial documentation.  It is completely breaking of the game, and really a failure on 11-bit's part to not integrate the tutorial better.  The sad part is, we known they can integrate a tutorial into the natural flow of the game as that is how Frost Punk 1 worked.  Small pop-ups and events that happen in Frost Punk 1 guide the player and introduce new mechanics in a natural and well defined way, but sadly Frost Punk 2 forgoes all of this, instead condemning the player to break their immersion and spent time reading the tutorial instead of playing the game.

[h2]UI (Why is Everything White?)[/h2]
For a game that is set on largely white background, with largely white features, it is strange that the UI is also largely white or grey.  Generally, it is hard to read the, otherwise very gorgeous and well done UI, because everything just tends to blend into each other.  [spoiler]For instance, frost breaking, the act of breaking up the snow/ice so you can build there, requires the users to select tiles that are marked bright white, from tiles that either grey (already broken) or not as bright white (not accessible tiles).[/spoiler]  I generally am not sure how a visually impaired person is able to play this game as so many elements of the UI just blend in with each other.

The game does come with a dark mode, but the developers decided to throw a warning in that turning on dark mode will result in a lost of UI look and feel.  I guess the devs are trying to warn that dark mode is not the intended way to play, but if that is truly the case then maybe the devs should re-evaluate why they felt the need to include dark mode in the first place.  Additionally, for some reason dark mode does degrade some of the few colored elements in the UI, to monotone colors, which just seems completely unnecessary.  

[h2]Performance (Another New Game, Another Example of Terrible Launch Performance)[/h2]
The game tricks the user into thinking that the game will perform well as the initial half of a play through tends to play very well.  Movement is fluid, clicks are responsive, and saves are not disruptive, but somewhere around the half way point everything starts to fall apart.  

Take saving, the game defaults to auto-saving at regular intervals and, importantly, the game is completely frozen while a save is happening.  At first, this minor inconvenience as the auto-save will freeze the game for a second and is generally not an issue, but as the city grows the time it takes to save also grows.  This ultimately culminates in 30+ second long save times when in the late game (all saves are to SSDs).  This is exasperated by the auto-save feature which makes it very frustrating to be dealing with a crisis in the game and then suddenly everything stops, you can't click on anything, you can't do anything, but look at the ""<saving...>"" window and wait, and wait, and wait....  The save performance completely breaks the immersion, and I ultimately thought about turning off auto-saves because it was so disruptive, but doing so would have made the random crashes much more painful.

What would a game launch be without random, game breaking, crashes, and Frost Punk 2 has them in spades.  I will not go into all the issues the Mac community is having as I do not play on a Mac, but they are many and loud on the discord.  No, instead I will focus on my, and my partners, Windows play through.  There appears to be an issues with the game crashing when playing at max speed, and while I did not encounter many crashes, my partner did and they where to the point that they needed to save frequently (remember the save issue, yea, it is even worst when combined with the crashes).  The only main difference between our two devices, I have an Intel CPU, and my partner has an AMD CPU, so maybe there is an issue with AMD CPUs but I do not know for certain.  All I can say is that the same is completely unstable and you are basically forced to play with auto-immersion-breaking-saving on. 

The bright side, 11-bit has been working on trying to resolve these issues and I am hopeful that the issues will be resolved with patches in the coming days/weeks.

[h2]Frost Punk Soul (Where did it go?)[/h2]
All of the above issues with the game can be resolved with patches and updates over time, but the by far the biggest issue with Frost Punk 2 is the [i]almost[/i] lack of soul.  One of the great things about FP 1 is the decisions a player has to make just in who works where, do the children work in the mines (which they yearn for) or does it fall to an automaton?  These kinda of intimate interactions are completely missing from the game, instead [spoiler]districts pull from a generic pool of workers, are they children? Maybe.  They could also be automatons or the elderly, who knows![/spoiler]  These interactions, and others, are what made FP 1 so great and also so hard, but achievable.  I have hard a lot of players say that FP 2 is so much harder than FP 1 ever was, but I do not feel like that difficulty is truly because the game is harder.  Instead, the game generally feels harder not because it is harder, but because the player has significantly less tools to deal with any given crisis.  [spoiler]Instead, the player is left to building districts and sending out exploration teams, while occasionally throwing some stubborn party a gift/punishment to keep them from trying to tear everything down.[/spoiler]  Ultimately, the only time I felt truly moved or emotional was the very end of the story, which presents the player with an almost deep philosophical dive into the what is means to create a ""utopia"".   This is really the heart of FP 2 issues, the new scale of the game means that the intimate details that made FP 1 great are completely lost, and I am not sure there is a good way that can be fixed without some major redesigns.

[h2]Final Thoughts[/h2]
Generally, FP 2 is a good and unique city builder game, the additional content truly pushes the boundaries and fulfills some wishes of FP 1. Sadly FP 2 is not the gritty [b]survival[/b] city builder that FP 1, and that is why I have a hard time recommending this game anyone other than a purely city builder fan.  I really hope that 11-bit can find away to bring back in some the moral and heart felt soul of FP 1, but until then, FP 2 feel just like a shell of the greatness that is FP 1.",False,english,76561197983564021,14.166666666666666,2024-09-25 05:37:43

I think the problem with this one is the district system and gameplay mechanics makes city planning rather uninteresting. In the first game if something is well planned, you could temporarily at least be ""ahead of the curve"". In this installment, pretty much impossible at harder difficulty levels to have neutral or positive states across most of the supply categories, so you just constantly toggle which you want to get ahead in. Negative states don't feel that impactful. What I would expect is for things to fall apart, except not really. I had negative housing for the a long duration and what I would expect is hundreds to start dying, but it took too long for too little people to die.

Some of the gameplay needs improvement too. E.g.: ""not enough workforce to build building"", but I do have workforce, just not enough. If I have 99% of the necessary workforce for a building, I still want those 99% to do something not just sit around. So workaround is to temporarily turn something to lower efficiency %, use the extra workforce to build new building, then tune new building down to 99% and reallocate the 1% back to original building. Not fun. Old model was better. Queue them all up and if you queue too many that's your problem.

Say what you will, but I love building roads (which you can't do here).",False,english,76561198012839407,4.916666666666667,2024-09-25 05:17:46

I only put about 60 hours into Frostpunk 1, but I was able to beat all of the campaign missions and DLCs on the 2nd highest difficulty. I became devoted to finally finishing them due to the immersion and difficulty. 

What 1 offered was a deeply immersive city builder where every choice you made, whether that was building something or a contextual event, could have a fairly significant impact on the entire play-through. 

Frostpunk 2 is something else entirely. There's no real connection with your ""citizens"" outside of the ""faction"" representatives. Nothing you do really seems to matter like it did in the first. Now, the overall gameplay is more similar to City Skylines than it is Frostpunk 1. Of course, some decisions you make in Frostpunk 2 have an impact, but it's far less.... impactful.... than the first. 

HOWEVER.... That doesn't mean Frostpunk 2 is a bad game. In fact, it's actually pretty damn awesome... And that's exactly why it's so insanely polarising. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone that enjoyed the first, as well as games like Cities Skylines.

This game has been one of my most anticipated games this year, as it was for many others, and 11-Bit Studios did not disappoint. While the first game was about survival and enduring through the hardships of the severe cold, Frostpunk 2 is about the comeback of civilization. It's much more large scale, which I personally love, and more difficult to manage. I've found that this is more about managing society than the cold, even though it's still a major part of the game. The Laws that you approve or decline may not align with what certain factions believe in. You may have to negotiate with them to win their favor.

You'll see a lot of reviews on here complaining that this diverted too much from what made Frostpunk great and you'll see a lot of people saying that the changes made here go in the wrong direction. I disagree. This game is still VERY Frostpunk: the game throws you into the frostland and you must keep the generator running and supplies coming all while the people of your city bicker and complain about the direction you take the city. The political side of Frostpunk 2 is vastly expanded on; passing laws and pleasing factions are far more important this time around. It is a core fundamental aspect of this sequel to delve into the political landscape of your city and carefully pick and choose which laws are passed and which factions to support. The final chapter of the campaign was so intense I literally can't remember a time where a game like this got me to that level of engagement and immersion. 

You'll learn A LOT about how to progress more successfully with each new city you make, whether it be trying the campaign on harder difficulties or picking different maps in the Utopia mode. I've now gone through three runs each with varying levels of success: the first one being marginally successful just enough to get by, the second one being vastly successful ensuring that my city stands long after I die, and the third crumbling from existence because of my inability to rule it properly. This game's insistence on forcing you to learn is extremely engaging and it really is the key reason why I can see myself putting dozens of more hours into this. 

Exploring the frostland and building resource outposts, surviving the blizzards, and ensuring every faction has their voice heard all make for a gameplay system that constantly keeps you engaged and really never gives you a dull moment. Each new run on a new map presents new challenges and new opportunities. 

While many will be disappointed that this isn't the same as Frostpunk 1, I think the evolution made in this entry still makes it extremely engaging and I have high hopes for the future of this franchise.

It's not a bad game in my eyes, but it lacks a clear vision. I personally don't like the direction the devs went in. I think all this game has to offer should have just been introduced into the first game. Such as establishing colony outposts and expanding beyond your initial city.

Nothing really matters anymore. Death? It used to make me cringe everytime I'd hear the bell in the first game. Knowing there was a huge problem in my city, knowing that I was losing CRUCIAL workforce. In this game, whenever I hear the death sound I just don't care. People are endless in this game. You can find them all over the frostland, plus you get population growth. 

Also, the main plot? It kinda sucks honestly. At least the ending I got. I pledged to overpower the cold and restore a warm spot. But I didn't even get to see anything cool out of it! All the sacrifice, all the voices I suppressed. And I didn't even get to see like, plants growing or the local climate actually warming! All I did was burn extra fuel for literally nothing in return. Unless you call the game guilt-tripping me for suppressing other voices a reward. Look.. I get the idea behind the plot. You're supposed to listen to everyone. You can't create a ""utopia"" with one vision. Well guess what? It's STUPID. This is not a deep, enriching experience. The first game it certainly felt horrible when you crossed the line, this game it has no emotional impact on me. 

The soundtrack is kinda good, I'd still say the first game is better though. That's how I feel about the whole game honestly. ""Kinda good, but the first one is better.""
The one thing about this game I love is the frostland and colonization. That's something I deeply wanted in the first game. Other than that though, I would prefer the first game.",False,english,76561198084879233,15.65,2024-09-25 01:36:14

I played a Welshman who's name started with G, and who's two loyal soldier camp followers also had names that started with Gs. Notable recruits of ours;
- A starving hedge knight disturbed by all the soldiers without lords who care for them.
- A Rabbi, whom became my best friend and right hand.
- A boy raised by wolves who I inherited as my son.

Then, during year three, I decided to brave a great adventurer; I would travel to Athens and make the Welsh Cockrels heroes among the Byzantines. 

No.

Instead, we lost one of our original members off the northern coast of Italy to a storm, and then we ALL died in a storm on the southern tip of Italy. My Rabbi friend and I held eachother as a wave crushed us all to death.

Easily the best for CK3, and given some of the other recent DLCs have been very good, that is saying something. 

Maybe a little over-priced, but the fact it launched with all planned features implemented and I couldn't find a single bug in it (so far) suggests they put a lot of genuine work into it, so I don't at all feel ripped off here. The changes are no small changes either, they essentially built an entire second game inside the game!

This has added a dimension to Crusader Kings that it has never had, and makes it possible to play just about anyone in the world. You don't like managing an empire? No worries, just manage your camp!!

Intrigue and Stewardship just became waaaay more useful than previously, and plots are much more involved with their own stories, and it lays the foundation for nomadic and republic systems to be easily added on top of these new systems.

I can just vibe on the steppes as my little band of nomadic raiders now, or be a valiant knight in France rescuing damsels in distress, or support peasant revolts overthrowing tyrannical lords!

started in 867 as a custom norsemen in denmark Robbed the nobles blind and decided I should probably leave, traveled to Spain to try and help Asturias, failed, moved to Navarre, robbed them and got kicked out, went to Barcelona to help out a faction, lost, decided to go to italy to get landed, nearly died after running critically low on provisions. Landed in Salerno then immediately ate someone from hunger, you can guess the dukes response (he told me to get the hell out) I went up to naples instead, then conquered a small isolated and weak muslim count in calabria, I then killed every muslim ruler there and, now at  54, 33 years after I started, Im the duke of Calabria.

The patch seems to be healthy overall for the game (flashbacks to release of Legends of the Dead and rampaging diseases)

Took me about 200 turns to figure out most of it (in about 12 hours of game play) and I'm not even out of ACT 1 yet. I'm sure there is more to learn still! :)

The only problem game play loop I had was is when trying to deal with all the logistics (you're playing a supply chain & logistics game) as there was no easy way (UI) to get an overview of what building is producing what and what upgrades it was missing and what supplies it needed etc, or so I assumed!!! 

I figure it out though. If you go into a CITY, top right corner there is a drop down and you can pick various things, such as ZONES, IMPROVEMENTS, CRAFTERS & HARVESTERS and now you have a complete picture of what your city is doing and what needs to be assigned/upgraded/allocated etc perfectly fine and you can do it all there, you do not have to click on every individual building on the map (outside of the city menu) anymore (unless you want to of course). Now I really enjoy this part of the game!

Combat... not what I expected in a GOOD way! I though it would be another boring CIV 6 type fight but oh no! You will have to maneuver around your combat units/formations and since turns are happening simultaneously you might not even ""catch"" the enemy so easily as you might think heh heh.

Mobile/Fast units are quite nice, at least for the one war I had. It was something like 30 vs 30 totals units and it took around 25 turns to conclude it and the battle(s) were all over several zones etc. Think medieval /ancient type battles where it took armies a while to find favorable terrain and so forth. I like it. I need many more hours to learn everything there is about it. I think it's a bit more to it then what meets the eye (to be the best General/Tactician I can be heh heh)

It's a pretty game, that's for sure. I like it. I had zero problems with crashes or bugs. My FPS was around 35 once there was a lot of things on the map, but that was with everything on maxed out settings, so very beautiful. This is not a game where you need a boatload of FPS, you're playing a turned based game that requires no reaction time. The performance is perfectly acceptable on my PC! Your mileage may vary though.

Anyway, I'll keep playing the game until I've gone through all the acts and so forth and completed the game and I'll update my review (if needed) once done.

Victoria 3 is my favorite paradox game and it introduces the skeleton of an amazing game, but it had pretty rough UI navigability and was a bit bare bones on some features. After a year of updates all those problems got fixed and now Vicky 3 is fantastic. The devs are very active on the discord and are well aware of the UI issues in this game, as well as the features that need work, and they are funded for the entire first year to provide free updates to fix both.

The crafting is quite extensive and you can tell they put a lot of love into it, and it's particularly satisfying to see your civilization grow and develop, as opposed to say the Civ series which while fun in its own right, doesn't really demonstrate that besides the occasional house popping up here and there along with the buildings changing depending on the technological age you're in.

The diplomacy is very basic, and definitely leaves a lot to be desired, but it's not any worse than Civ VI's. 

The battles aren't Total-War complex, but the formations feature allowing you to put units into a battalion together is quite a nice touch, I was worried it was going to just be ""craft a unit and then send it out or whatever) but there is a basic aspect of tactical planning involved there, which I definitely hope to see expanded on in the future as well.

TL;DR It leaves a bit more to be desired in terms of complexity in other areas besides crafting, and is hampered by some launch day performance issues, but is overall a genuinely solid game.",True,english,76561198120733591,4.033333333333333,2024-09-25 04:26:10

There's a a lot of attention to detail especially in making choices like if you are in the bottom (I think 4) ranking at the end of any of the acts(think of like timeline stages) your game is over or any of the AI is out, basically a built in game design that prevent civs having to far of a gap between their capabilities, which if was left in the game usually makes it not as fun of an experience. I believe civ 7 also mentioned they were doing something similar to this. That should also really help multiplayer games where people far way behind and theres no point in them continuing to stay in the game. I like the little battle scenes you can watch (optional), they're exactly what I've always wanted to see in CK3, wish they would take notes. Game feels pretty polished right out of the gate and I'm excited to continue and finish my first play through. I've seen some negative reviews saying it needs optimized. I look at it like this, if you want a new 2024 game with amazing clear detailed graphics, and a lot of moving detailed parts in the world that you can zoom way in or way out and still see most of everything doing their things, then you better have a 2024 spec pc (or close to it). I've had zero issues but I'm running a i9-9900 cpu with a 4090 gpu. I've played other games where even with my high specs the frames drop real low and has stuttering so to me this game is optimized pretty good especially on launch day. Hopefully they can make some more options to lower the settings for those with lower spec pc's though. If you like a mix of civ with humankind (just like civ 7 has some humankind features) and like someone else said anno's industries details then give it a shot. I can already see myself sinking a lot of hours into this, then when civ 7 comes out I'll get to do the same and compare :)",True,english,76561198032539149,7.15,2024-09-25 03:22:15

I have a couple of grievances, however, they are relatively minor. Unit and culture diversity could have been interesting.

What is a little ridiculous is the lack of nuclear weapons... I mean come on. I guess it'll be in a DLC? I hope... if they are there, then my bad, they aren't in the tech tree.

I also hope there is a way to continue after the hard turn limit, that would probably flip me to not recommend as that's an artificial barrier that is inexcusable in a modern 4x game. Humankind learnt that.

It's heavy on production chains (only other 4x I know of that does this is Millennia) and heavy on producing good to make other things.  It's really like a mix of a 4x and Anno, with 4x level of city building and the detailed production chains and goods production of Anno.  Combat looks to be fairly simple but you can stack units.  You can get bonuses by creating formations as well but the battles play out in an in-the-game-world combat animation.  It's not a seperate combat window like Millennia but is in the game world itself if you want to watch it (which is totally optional) and they look really nice.  Nothing like Millennia's ugly combat window.
I haven't played more than 3 hours so far but there's seems to be a lot of depth to the game.  It's quite detailed in it's gameplay and graphically.  People go about their business in the cities you build and even have fun little animations when hovered over or clicked on.  But boy does it give your graphics card a workout.  I'm running a 4070 Super and on ultra settings with no limits on framerate it pegs the card.  Dropping it to a hard 60FPS sorted that out though.  CPU and memory are not heavily hit, just GPU.

If there's one genre I've spent most of my time in, it's the 4x genre. I've got thousands of hours in civ and stellaris. I was a bit unsure of whether or not to pick up ara based on early videos I saw online, I thought the micromanagement would get to me and it kind of does. I think the game has got that kind of special secret sauce that keeps me coming back and wanting to keep playing while avoiding some of the pitfalls of others in the genre (cough cough humankind) and introducing something fresh.

Firstly, just to get this out of the way, I've got a beastly PC running it on max settings and I never had any performance issues so I can't speak much to that. This review will be solely on the gameplay and what I like and dislike about it.

Like:
-The realistic feel of city expansion and district manipulation. Civ always felt too abstract and board-game like especially civ 6. This game introduces a level of depth that's very pleasing to toy around with.
-The details of buildings, cities, with little people and units walking around and being able to zoom very far in to see a living world that makes you feel like youre actually playing through history.  It's a step civ has never taken and I always wished they would.
-The core gameplay loop of analyzing production chains, making choices to suit your city's needs, optimizing, crafting, etc. It scratches an itch the city builder and anno enjoyer side of me finds very pleasing. Toying with these systems to get a desired outcome is very satisfying to do.

Neutrals
-Leader variety is nice, giving us 36 options from the beginning is a lot more variety than I expected. But a lot of them just feel weird. First playthrough is Copernicus of poland, which is cool, I guess, but also kind of... odd?
-The act-end cullings, this is... idk. I praised the game for its commitment to actually feeling like playing through history before but this mechanic really goes straight against that. empires randomly falling at the end of each act with the others able to scoop up their land? Kinda cool, could take it or leave it.
-Diplomacy, AI, Religion, etc. None of these systems are particularly fleshed out but I would encourage people to remember the ""base"" versions of games like Civ and Stellaris when they were first released without any DLC and how barebones those felt compared to how you can play them today. I think ara delivers a sufficient amount of content for several playthroughs.

Bad:
-The UI is just not very useful. It takes an ungodly amount of clicks to do something as simple as giving a farm a plow or heavy plow.
-Resource & Crafting management: I really enjoy the resource management this game gives and the ability one has to tweak productions, but especially in the late game it becomes a very tiring aspect as you have to navigate the sheer volume of stuff your empire produces. The game is in desperate need of some kind of automation or settings changes to make this more friendly on the player and not so tiresome. Like plows simply being auto doled out to farms in need. I think my biggest issue with this part of the game is just how dramatically it slows the overall pace down.

Overall, I'm probably going to keep playing Ara for a little while at least. I'm eager to see if Oxide and Microsoft enable modding and what directions they take the game in with future DLC. I think if you like 4x you'll probably enjoy playing this game.

Firstly, had to change some settings to get the visuals smooth. By default felt like edge scrolling/ moving around map was a bit choppy. Once that was fixed I started to get into it.

Huge learning curve. Really need to unlearn what you know in Civ and learn what Ara is all about. Its, got a different feel to it. I generally play peaceful in Civ, but in Ara I HAD to go to war. AI settling next to my capital? Nope thats not staying there! But I genuinely enjoyed the battles, even if they were simple to understand I think this is something that Civ 6 did wrong where battles and wars take a lot more micro management in Civ by bringing the units you need to the battle and shuffling around all the time, Ara gets you to preset your armies and give them formations and leaders and just put them up against the enemy. Less hassle

I saw someone say politics plays no part in Ara, I strongly disagree. Having an ally for the set amount of time that you do really helps. And maintaining that relationship I thought was really important, especially toward the end of the act. I had two AI declare war on me and with my ally it felt like ""teams"" trying to keep their positions on the board before the next act starts. I love the trade contracts. Playing as victoria I start with an extra trade route. Plus adding more routes those trade agreements really did me well. It makes trade valuable because I was getting a lot of good things from my ally and possibly more than she was getting from me because I had a focus in trade.

Im not sure about AI balancing though. When setting up the initial games, I tried a harder difficulty, when you mouse over the difficulties tool tip shows you some info, like ""small bonuses, or no bonuses"". I tried a much harder difficulty that said ""no bonuses"" but the AI were somehow constantly earning almost double prestige. Lowered to Prince and up to end of Act 1 I am winning mostly with 3200 prestige versus 2nd place of 3000 prestige. I might knock it up one level next game.

The length of the act felt long, possibly 5-6 hours, felt almost like a whole game and could stop here just after act one and say I was satisfied, but of course Im looking forward to playing next act now. I can see why the culling mechanic was added too. Its refreshes the game, like theres new focus, not like when you play civ and its the same all the way through.

Im not trying to crap all over Civ mind you. Civ is great, but Ara is fresh, its different

Its not for everyone. Need to be ready to learn a new game. Took me a while to get the grasp of the mechanics. Defo not as accessible or as familiar as Civ. But with some patience you certainly get your moneys worth. I suspect Im going to be putting hundreds of hours into this one

On the negative all I can say is apart from that little change I had to do with game settings to get it running smoother, which possibly there could be some optimization here just to get that camera to be much smoother, the crafting mechanic.. this one is although a really really nice addition, also completely impossible to keep track of. Sure there are notifications when something is not building, but you will find yourself building crafting goods and not paying attention to what was built all the time, and then every now and again go through every single building to see what tools can be used and where. Its slow and laborious. Shouldnt be this awkward.Maybe I missed something in the menus that could list all the buildings and show their upgrades in a nice tidy list, but the tutorial hasnt told me anything that can be used to this effect. Also city planning just gets lost, theres so much info on screen and though you have a list to the right showing the different zones and an icon showing the building in a slot, there needs to be something where that list might have a better visual aid to see whats actually in those slots rather than having to mouse over each icon, but the clutter that is the main screen when you are trying to annex a zone or place a building is almost useless. I heard of complaints of the UI, and I get it.

I suspect they will patch something here eventually, because it certainly has had a lot of love already. There is so much here and Im very happy with my purchase, just need a bit of patience to learn what it is.",True,english,76561197996176982,8.566666666666666,2024-09-25 01:35:19

Compared to its predecessors, it is much simpler and streamlined and feels much more like playing a physical board game with narrative vignettes than a 4k war strategy game.  Instead of splitting into the dichotomy of kingdom building and war strategy, RTK14 splits the difference.  There are no tactical battles.  The big map is the tactical map.  There is no build up and then strike, you are constantly at war and constantly defending yourself.  The pace is much faster than any other Koei strategy title I've messed with, at the expense of complexity.  But warning, this game is unforgivably difficult and does very little to prepare for it.

The battle mechanics are way worse. They did some weird thing where you can only give an order or series of orders during your turn that plays out in the battle phase. Sounds ok at first, but you'll soon find units sitting around and waiting after destroying an enemy unit while 4 hexes away another enemy army is beating up your ally. It's all based around the AI settings that you put forth, but the AI is too simplistic to be intuitive, or even show some semblance of intelligence.

You'll find everything is based around AI. All you do as a ruler is use excel with a poor UI. Duels? Only watching as two dudes just hit each other. Debates? What's that? Marriage/sworn brothers system, 10,000g for a slight buff in battle and loyalty.  Don't even get me started on their new event system.

There's not room for roleplay or to immerse yourself. Just play ROTK 8, 10, or 11, they are just more in depth and provide more. 

There is no desire for me to develop my generals. They provide you tons of skills to train your generals. But it's just a chore and takes so much time for no benefit. Maybe if I had some sort of attachment to my generals in any shape or form, I would. But it's all just stats.

For Christ's sake, ROTK4 had more depth in it and that was a SNES game on 16 bits. I don't know who they are trying to entertain with this game.",False,english,76561198053796791,51.36666666666667,2024-05-11 17:06:37

Difficulty Employing Characters Like Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Cai Yan: Despite numerous attempts, we're unable to employ characters like Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Cai Yan. We keep receiving alerts that they're unemployed, yet they continue to reject our offers.

Lackluster Area/City Government Mechanics: The mechanics for managing area and city governments are dull. It simply involves assigning an officer and then repeatedly sending idle officers out for employment until orders are depleted.

Much better than my expectation. I played version II long time ago, and recently played Total war 3K and Civ6. This game series is always unique, charming, and has its own style. It brings me back to good old days with some additional feelings from other mentioned games.  

Game play and design is probably the strongest point. I appreciate tons of game mechanics that rarely found from other games in the same genre. The aesthetics, graphics, character designs, and map details are also superb. It can compare to Total war 3K, and I also found many points it is even better.

Even though, it might not be a perfect game (some mechanics or stuffs seems useless e.g. plot/diplomatic or lacking of well UI design which causes too many unnecessary clicks), but it seems to be only small points comparing to its overall quality.
