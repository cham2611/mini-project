Ignoring that fact, I hate the continuous push for online gameplay.
I'm not an online player. I like to play offline. Alone.
Ultimate Team is kind of addictive and Squad Battles was my favorite mode since it was introduced. Rush sadly is another online mode, adding to the already never ending list of online modes. Squad Battles was the only decent mode for me.
But it seems EA decided to nerf/kill it by decreasing the Squad Battles weekly games from 32 to 14!!!
I can't personally understand the reasoning behind this.
Why does every FC player need to play online? Do I have to rely on Career mode? Or just Kick-off?

Pros:
-Fantastic lore/world building
-Fantastic gameplay
-Huge world with things to do
-Great graphics/art direction
-Phenomenal soundtrack 
-Easy to get into for casual gamers, with plentiful options to make the game significantly easier

Cons:
-PC stuttering caused by shader compilation
-Certain bosses reward good RNG for a run instead of only outplaying them, however every boss is beatable with pure skill alone even if the boss uses their hardest/cheesiest moves. For example beating Malenia felt more like getting a good run than out-skilling her,
-World is vast but does not reward exploration for your specific build (i.e. there's no point in exploring if you already have a build in mind with specific talismans, etc.). Basically if there's nothing you need in a certain area then there's no point going there except for leveling purposes.
-Final boss of the main game is one of the worst main bosses

My Build:
-Melee only strength/stagger build with a two-handed colossal great sword, lion's claw, talismans that boost this playstyle, no summons, no cheesing bosses

Pros
-feels like a older game in the gameplay sense, feels like the original gears of war games or halo
-After 100 hours im still looking foward to playing more
-Day 1 gave us a road map detailing the next year of content new maps for pve and pvp, new modes for pvp and pve, new enemies in pve, new weapons and more
-PvP is incredibly fun and isnt a grind fest to jump into the fun, hop in do some pvp, go back to pve no problem
- Gameplay as a whole is the best part of the game, its never been more fun to hop in and kill some heretics or some nids with a fury that would make the God Emperor of Mankind proud
-perk system is not overly complicated
-HIGH SKILL CEILING on higher difficulties when it comes to keeping your health afloat so long as your not using a melta weapon in which case the game is easy mode

cons

-issues with servers right now
-weapon balance needs to be fixed (bolt weapons need a fix for pve)
-certain enemies on ruthless difficulty feel way too meat spongy
-some extremis enemies will sometimes never die regardless of damage dealt sometimes which can kill runs on higher difficulties
-need more maps but they are otw",True,english,76561198141728573,99.5,2024-09-25 05:13:29

But it has come back and came back stronger with more presences  that I'm happy more gamers and big mains-streamers/youtubers are getting into 40k more than ever of any 40k games i've known for these past 20 years since i got into the franchise, and i gotten into the series since dawn of war 1 rts style.

Some annoying things i will say about Space marine 2 compared to 1 is just lack of heal options outside of 2 stim LIMIT YOU RARELY FIND WHEN YOU NEED IT, as they ""changed"" away health regeneration off of iconic ""execution"" and only apply it to your ""Armor"" (totally not shield mechanic) but the armor recharge gauge requires you to be not in combat or danger for FIFTEENTH WHOLE SECONDS.  Still doesn't sound that bad? if it wasn't SO ANNOYING while cutting mobs up, while range enemies OUT DPS the time im MELEEING TANKY ENEMIES INTO EXECUTION STATE.

Beat up your friends and family in spectacular fashion by throwing bombs, hitting them with a shovel, punching them in the face, smacking them or yourself with nunchucks or tasing them with a taser. Do all of this while looking like the most adorable little evil menace that you can customize to your liking. 

Had enough of the team beatup game for a bit? Try the coop pirate mode where you have to fend of a bunch of pirates with your friends or maybe try one of the team game modes like football, hockey or american football. Looking for something different than smashing enemies? Maybe the winter cabin mode is better for you with a bunch of cozy activities and card games. Feeling more like playing a certain kart racer, but dont want to go through the hazzle of paying for another game? Try Nemo Kart (its also in this game)!

Other note worthy stuff:
- Game requires a consistent internet connection, there is no offline mode (yet).
- You can invite a friend along without them having to pay for the game.
- Cosmetics in the game are 99.9% obtainable with in game currencies or through events, exceptions are certain collab skins. 
- All the event passes (battle passes) have been completely free up til now.
- The game updates consistantly.
- There is no penguin animal skin (pls Recreate i beg).",True,english,76561198111818170,61.766666666666666,2024-09-24 23:37:49

This game was a blast and I understand the devs are working hard on the npcs and I hope its worth it, but ive waited over a decade of my life to see semblance of what would change this game forever. They've been dangling this carrot in front of us for over a decade. Its actually wild. At one point npcs were talked about so much that they started muting and banning people over it. I don't blame them. What I do blame them for is how long this has taken. Over a decade really? No transparency until recently. Used to be my favorite devs, now i'm just sad. B42 now to B43, I feel like npcs are never gonna happen. 


Maybe instead of perfecting a decade old game you guys should complete this product and move on to the next with bigger and better ideas. 
Maybe you guys should realize we aren't looking for perfection and looking for more gameplay mechanics to extend the life of this game. 

How about you fix your shit with player feedback?

Or is the code so far gone you are gonna push back the date for eternity or until you tell us its scrapped? 

I'm only saying this out of a place of love for the game you guys have made and as a 
disappointed customer.
