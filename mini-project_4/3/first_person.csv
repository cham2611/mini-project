Pros:
- Stunning scenes with adaptive lighting, bloom, focus blur, and filters. Combine it with camera work and it's a marvel of game visuals.
- Lots of customization options.
- Calming BGM + satisfying ASMR SFX. Even as you hover over colors to pick, there are singular xylophone sounds playing with each option.
- Highly adaptive procedural adaptations as well as decorative nuances. Bird nests popping up in roof creases and sheeps floating with umbrellas being my cherries-on-top.
- No visible limiting grid, or as they'd say, 'gridless.'
- Very low price compared to what it offers.
- Demo save transfers well into the full game.

Some introductory tutorials in sandbox games can be invasive and interrupting a smooth gameplay, especially if you skip it or will miss something major if you do. This game isn't about that.

You're welcome to explore on your own what this droplet button does, what dragging this wall sideways will do, what will happen if you choose to put three windows together, etc. With the vast customization and options, I find that in my first 3 hours of playing, I keep learning new things non-stop.

You're not spoon-fed with rules, told to run tasks, follow a story, or even taught how to do things - instead, you adapt on your own, just like how the game adapts to what little changes you do. You make the glade feel like home, and the game gladly returns the favor, creating a flourishing mutualistic ecosystem and the humbling sandbox experience that the game is.

Bugs found:
- Certain bugs for item positioning/adaptation. Ex: ivy remains floating in the air from removed/shrunk buildings.
- Camera bugs. Ex: camera got stuck in one zoomed angle, can still move but always returns to the stuck angle. Restarting the game resets it and no progress were lost.

Suggestions for developers to add:

- Options to group objects together
- Controls to lock & unlock objects from moving or changing
- Controls to copy, cut, and paste objects/group of objects
- Options to pick and drop color, also to color multiple objects at once
- Options to enable interactive humans/humanoid characters to inhabit or explore glades the way wild animals do
- Additional water/terrain option: automatic square or circular shape in addition to the manual drawing option
- Additional delete option: wipe the entire scene out of trees, buildings, etc with just one click
- Options to manually add furniture/items for decor aside from automatic procedural adaptations
- Options to generate bridges with different styles (as opposed to people manually making it with building tricks)
- Options to generate stairs with different styles (as opposed to people also manually making it with building tricks)
- Options to generate moving water like rivers or waterfalls.
- Options to generate more terrain items like stones, logs, stumps, as well as more variation of flowers and plants.
- Additional options to change the weather, i.e cloudy, raining, etc
- And ofc more choice for scenes & building styles, perhaps some that captures dark gothic aesthetic or eastern/oriental style designs if that already hasn't been in development (highly suspect it has)

Aside from how well-developed this game already is, I really appreciate how well-loved it is too, both by the players and developers. This seems like a game my past younger self, my current self, and my future elderly self, all would love to play regardless of time and relevance.

I have been waiting for this game to come out for quite some time, the simple relaxing nature of the tiny glade drew me in for a chill gaming experience, I was not disappointed. Its a charming and creative experience for when you don't want a shooter or strategy game. Its a good way to unwind after a long day, something to do when you want to express your creativity, or you just want to escape to your little slice of peaceful bliss. Don't expect to ""win"" or ""lose"" in this game, there is no victory conditions, just build a castle or what once was a castle, build a farm, a town, or a village, its up to your interpretation. I do wish the glade wasn't so... tiny, and I wish you could control, move, and spawn more animals, but its a small nitpick.

Its a game that can take you somewhere new, or back in time, or so it feels.

After finally folding and purchasing the base game at a discount, I quickly grew to love the combat system, methods of gaining power, and especially the story the game told. The most important part of any game to me is the story, followed by the combat mechanics, then the graphics. Cyberpunk smashed all my expectations so much so that I purchased Phantom Liberty at full price when I was halfway through the game, solely because I knew I wanted more content before the end of the game. I'm very glad I did. The DLC has been wonderful, and without spoiling it, I would rate it 2 tiers above the base game (7/10 - base, 9/10 DlC, for an average of 8/10). Note that 5/10 simply means ""average"" and reasonable for the experience/price. I fully recommend the DLC if you enjoyed the base game.",True,english,76561198851611961,0.0,2024-09-22 20:20:17

1. For some reason, when the chase starts and you get hit by a car and continue driving, we did not continue. Our car got pushed to the gate and didn't move. I had to restart.
2. Then when you start fighting scavs, it's needlessly hard. It's my 2nd playthrough, on hard difficulty. On hard, I killed Adam Smasher on 2nd try at just lvl 35 with sucky cyberware, and I'd say Adam Smasher is one of the hardest bosses in the game. This thing took me 5 tries. My advice -- when you get out of car, you get blades. Forget the blades, get back to pistol, find cover and be very careful as they'll shred you very quickly. Be careful with skulls and netrunners. First time I got killed by a runner.
3. After finally doing this, I go to the ""wounded scav"" and... nothing happens. It's bugged again. Trust me, I tried everything and I don't think I did anything unusual to cause it. 

At this point I just lost it. Come on, The DLC had been out for a year now, and the base game is 4 years old at this point. I understand that making games of this scale is hard. Even after 4 years, in the base game content, I still encounter some small bugs but I'm like ""okay, no biggie"".

What really got AC going for me was and still is the replay feature. There's just something magic to leaning back in your chair and enjoying the mayhem you've brought onto your objectives.

The most realistic parts of this game and series as a whole:
- The look of the aircraft, ordinance, and effects.
- Some of the atmospheric effects: weather, vector trails, vapour, albeit no contrails above FL300ish as of yet.
- The diversity in aircraft types.
- The air battle management dialogue and presentation, which is fairly well depicted for a video game. It's clear that they consulted with real Tactical Air Traffic controllers on some level.
- The depiction of Tactical Data Link in a practical sense, especially with regard to ID classification.
- Playtime WRT length of missions.
- Plot points such as electronic warfare, drones, AI.
The least realistic parts:
- Let's be honest, ammunition load-out storage. Ridiculous. But the missions would be 5 minutes long, force you to land and take off repeatedly, or only have a couple land targets and a single enemy fighter group otherwise.
- Mechanics of fighter jet flight. Totally ridiculous. But fun and arcade-esque.
- Mechanics of air weapon flight. Ridiculous to keep up with the aircraft they are targeting. Fair enough.
- Fidelity of radar, comms, and link coverage. Not realistic for things to just work perfectly everywhere always. Just a game though.
- Plot points such as gigantic aircraft carriers, rail guns, and space elevators. Too expensive in the real world to ever make sense. Alluring as a fantasy depiction for sure.
- Pilot response to the ridiculous acceleration/deceleration and +/-G forces. That is not at all depicted in the series during gameplay. However it is mentioned in cutscenes.
- Supersonic depiction, something that I have only seen accurately depicted in flight simulator.
- It would be cool to have an depiction of Mach, IAS, and TAS if not for pure effect.
- It would be cool to have the cockpit depict information completely much like the VR presentation.

If I missed anything... well you'll see. I highly recommend any game in this series. This is the best seller for a reason but the story is a little more compelling in AC4 and its subsequent releases. Hopefully one day we will get remakes and remasters because these games have a lot of replayability and the older titles are kind of forgotten given their generation. The developers don't have to improve too much to keep fans happy, aside from a better multiplayer experience and some minor touch-ups, such as inaccurate sound effects and a storyline that isn't really very sad.",True,english,76561198155871425,6.183333333333334,2024-09-21 14:21:36

LET ME EXPLAIN. Overall, I love this game. I really do. If I ignore Mario Games, Grounded has become my favorite video game of all time. I got into the game on version 1.3. Played the PC Pass Version with my friend, nearly finished the game. We quit right before 1.4 because we got busy.
Loved the game so much that I decided to buy it on Steam. I wanted to 100% it on Whoa! difficulty. Before I started this playthrough, I did see online about how bad 1.4 was balanced. I even saw how some YouTubers who focused on Grounded quit the game.
Now I see what they were talking about. When I started my 100% playthrough, it was right before 1.4.4. The game still has a bad balancing issue. NG+ is still just broken and unbalanced. to the point where it isn't enjoyable. Two examples: an infused bug can have the sour or fresh spell. They are just insane and barely possible to stop. I was pre-NG+ maxed out on equipment and stats. Even Infused Lawn Mites are a struggle. Also, it is now a grind to get the gear maxed out. The amount of fusion crystals it takes to upgrade a weapon from 9-15 is 105, and the time to get that is just nuts.

If you ignore NG+, the game really is amazing. I really do love this game, but NG+ balancing is just terrible. People can comment that it is a skill issue, but 1.4.4 didn't help much.",False,english,76561198140332561,167.78333333333333,2024-09-24 05:18:19
