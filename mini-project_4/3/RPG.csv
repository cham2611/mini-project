I'm a person who should love this game. HOWEVER: DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP. Paradox are scum merchant wanna-be pimps who don't care about making a game good or even coming close to CK2.

DO NOT SUPPORT A NOW TERRIBLE GAME COMPANY WHO ESSENTIALLY TELLS THEIR PLAYERS THIS:

""I want you to pay more for less. I don't want to make a good game. I won't add all the content from CK2 into the game unless you pay me to do the exact same work again, even though I already did all of that work and I am saving and holding back key gameplay mechancis to strategically milk you, the stupid player. I want all your money, and you are a stupid for buying the game, but that's your problem not mine. I wish I didn't have to develop games at all. I have no passion for strategy games, I do, however, like the sound of coins jingling as they come out of your pocket. Have a $15 DLC that changes nothing and is worse than the previous game (the black death one).. you will pay for it because you are stupid. Remember how good CK 2 was? Give me your money and I MIGHT, EVENTUALLY make the game like that...  I don't really care to make a good game or one that is even half of the previous one, but give me the money anyway. It's 3d people, that means you should pay me money. The new graphics are worth something right? Hmmm... I might be on to something here.... How about $15 for a few new models of a flag and a cup which give some flat bonuses (a couple of modders could do this work very easily and would have come up with something far more interesting. With a full team I can't believe that this took more than two-three weeks to actually make [if that even! We are talking flags, cups, and stilted idle animations that barely move at all!)... Did I mention I want your money and I don't want to work at making a game? My day is filled with drinking beer and doing nothing because you give me money to do that. Once my beer money starts running out I might code a half-baked mechanic while i'm hungover... I want your money, and I want to do as little as possible to get that money... give me the money. I want to make very, very, very small changes over time so that I don't have to work hard, then 5 years from now (that would be 9 years since release) the game will be like CK2 and you will have to buy all the DLC!!! MONEY, I LOVE THE MONEY, AND I DON'T LIKE TO WORK FOR IT! I don't want to make a good game, I want to make a game that makes you give me money. I hate my player base and I don't care if my game is worse than the previous version. No, I won't fix it for free, give me money. Buy this game instead of the old one because I will make more money. Did I mention the mechanics are half as deep and some are broken... who cares, give me the money. I added boobs into the game guys, real boobs, nips and all! That's worth some money right. Forget that you could mod that in if you wanted to in CK2 (plus who the hell cares anyway! If you want the pr0n0xxx just watch that for free guys), forget about CK2 and it's fully developed mechanics where each culture plays a lot different. That's actually bad game design because I want your money. If I give you a bad game now, and make you pay money to get even to half of what CK2 was that's good for me! Again, I want your money, I don't want to deliver a good product, but I still want your money. Here, take a DLC that is a broken version of IDENTICAL CONTENT FROM CK2... It's better because it is CK 3 instead of 2. Three is bigger than two, right? MONEY. I LOVE MONEY! I LOVE MONEY! I hate work. Excuse me while I go back to thinking about how I can do as little as possible while still getting you to pay for it, but, in reality I'm just going to go count your money instead... even thinking about the game is too much work. Stop expecting a good game guys, geez, game development is soooo hard... maybe a bit more money would motivate me to make an actual game for you.""

This game is worse than CK2 in almost every single way. There is nothing new here. Even with new DLC added it is HALF THE GAME THAT CK2 was. 

I ask you: WHAT IS THE POINT OF BUYING THIS GAME WHEN CK2 IS CHEAPER AND A BIGGER AND A BETTER GAME? Why buy this crap? Don't support the money-grubbing wanna-be pimps.

DON'T SUPPORT THE SCUM MERCHANTS. Don't buy rotting fish at the market, don't buy a rotting game from a dishonest broker. Save your money. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.",False,english,76561198103349403,230.2,2024-09-25 03:01:39

Extremely fun game but I rally disagree with Paradox's method of monetization. Some key mechanics that are considered fundamental for a playing experience are locked behind expensive DLC. Sure, 30$ might not mean much when you're american and you can probably spend at least 60$ every month with entertainment expenses, but in the case of most of the third world, the price is not properly adapted to our financial realities, most DLC costs more than 10% of my monthly income.

Pros:
-Fantastic lore/world building
-Fantastic gameplay
-Huge world with things to do
-Great graphics/art direction
-Phenomenal soundtrack 
-Easy to get into for casual gamers, with plentiful options to make the game significantly easier

Cons:
-PC stuttering caused by shader compilation
-Certain bosses reward good RNG for a run instead of only outplaying them, however every boss is beatable with pure skill alone even if the boss uses their hardest/cheesiest moves. For example beating Malenia felt more like getting a good run than out-skilling her,
-World is vast but does not reward exploration for your specific build (i.e. there's no point in exploring if you already have a build in mind with specific talismans, etc.). Basically if there's nothing you need in a certain area then there's no point going there except for leveling purposes.
-Final boss of the main game is one of the worst main bosses

My Build:
-Melee only strength/stagger build with a two-handed colossal great sword, lion's claw, talismans that boost this playstyle, no summons, no cheesing bosses

Not too familiar with it personally, so it was a nice breath of fresh air. 

The combat is fun and there's a lot of build variety. Sometimes the controls can feel a bit janky (feels like commands aren't queued up properly if your character is busy in an animation so it feels like you have to spam buttons to get one command out sometimes).

The story was relatively interesting. The end chapter animations were a huge highlight and a wonderful little decompression moment after the (usually) intense chapter end bosses.

Areas looked very beautiful but I definitely felt like level design itself was a bit lacking (even if the environments were gorgeous). Some areas dragged on for far too long and were kind of samey (chapter 5 really felt like it would never end). 

Overall, I definitely enjoyed the game and felt like the time I spent with it was worth it. I'm looking forward to the DLC.

Haven't tried out the Byzantine/administrative govt. stuff yet, but I'll try to remember to come back later once I do and update with my thoughts on that.

started in 867 as a custom norsemen in denmark Robbed the nobles blind and decided I should probably leave, traveled to Spain to try and help Asturias, failed, moved to Navarre, robbed them and got kicked out, went to Barcelona to help out a faction, lost, decided to go to italy to get landed, nearly died after running critically low on provisions. Landed in Salerno then immediately ate someone from hunger, you can guess the dukes response (he told me to get the hell out) I went up to naples instead, then conquered a small isolated and weak muslim count in calabria, I then killed every muslim ruler there and, now at  54, 33 years after I started, Im the duke of Calabria.

The patch seems to be healthy overall for the game (flashbacks to release of Legends of the Dead and rampaging diseases)

I have been playing CK for years, and up until now I considered modded CK2 superior to CK3 even, but ""Roads to Power"" not only pushes it in favour of CK3, it does so massively. Most DLC are extra flavour content for a particular region or religion or culture, but this DLC completely revamps a fundamental rule that's been in CK since CK1, you DON'T have to own land to play and have fun, on the contraire, I'd argue being landless is MORE fun. Played an MP game w/ my friends where I played a mercenary in Egypt who set up an entire criminal syndicate as he moved north through syria, before gaining land in syria DURING a crusade and managing to keep it. It took 20 years, but I did it, I got my county, and it felt good. Roaming from place to place as massive armies move around you was reminiscent of low level mount and blade gameplay.

2) landless can be played in many ways, sword for hire, scholar or even as a criminal
3) free patch adds gameplay post death swapping characters or (with dlc) continuing with the same if you were dethroned as a landless.
4) byzantines got new fresh content especially around the 4th crusade
5) so many new events and quiky choices
6) new scheme system
7) and historical characters add a lot of flavour to the campaign as landless.

10/10 dlc, way better than all the things we got so far. im very happy landless is fun, maybe a tad too op, but nothing broken or buggy aside few ""events"" or ui buttons. I highly reccomend this DLC especially if you feel the game doesnt offer enough RP opportunity.

After finally folding and purchasing the base game at a discount, I quickly grew to love the combat system, methods of gaining power, and especially the story the game told. The most important part of any game to me is the story, followed by the combat mechanics, then the graphics. Cyberpunk smashed all my expectations so much so that I purchased Phantom Liberty at full price when I was halfway through the game, solely because I knew I wanted more content before the end of the game. I'm very glad I did. The DLC has been wonderful, and without spoiling it, I would rate it 2 tiers above the base game (7/10 - base, 9/10 DlC, for an average of 8/10). Note that 5/10 simply means ""average"" and reasonable for the experience/price. I fully recommend the DLC if you enjoyed the base game.",True,english,76561198851611961,0.0,2024-09-22 20:20:17

1. For some reason, when the chase starts and you get hit by a car and continue driving, we did not continue. Our car got pushed to the gate and didn't move. I had to restart.
2. Then when you start fighting scavs, it's needlessly hard. It's my 2nd playthrough, on hard difficulty. On hard, I killed Adam Smasher on 2nd try at just lvl 35 with sucky cyberware, and I'd say Adam Smasher is one of the hardest bosses in the game. This thing took me 5 tries. My advice -- when you get out of car, you get blades. Forget the blades, get back to pistol, find cover and be very careful as they'll shred you very quickly. Be careful with skulls and netrunners. First time I got killed by a runner.
3. After finally doing this, I go to the ""wounded scav"" and... nothing happens. It's bugged again. Trust me, I tried everything and I don't think I did anything unusual to cause it. 

At this point I just lost it. Come on, The DLC had been out for a year now, and the base game is 4 years old at this point. I understand that making games of this scale is hard.

If you want to experience all four endings, you need to make a manual save right after Reed tells you to visit a special ripperdoc.
