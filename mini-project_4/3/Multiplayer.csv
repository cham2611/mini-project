Will change to a thumbs up once they've added new servers in hopefully this game continues to grow as I have high hopes for it!

UPDATE: Pretty disappointed at how the management is with this game as they try to do a lot of banning and not to mention banning stream snipers instead of focusing more time on actually trying to open new servers up so to get more exposure for the game.....Right now it's kind of a turn off so decided to uninstall it.

I'm a person who should love this game. HOWEVER: DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP. Paradox are scum merchant wanna-be pimps who don't care about making a game good or even coming close to CK2.

DO NOT SUPPORT A NOW TERRIBLE GAME COMPANY WHO ESSENTIALLY TELLS THEIR PLAYERS THIS:

""I want you to pay more for less. I don't want to make a good game. I won't add all the content from CK2 into the game unless you pay me to do the exact same work again, even though I already did all of that work and I am saving and holding back key gameplay mechancis to strategically milk you, the stupid player. I want all your money, and you are a stupid for buying the game, but that's your problem not mine. I wish I didn't have to develop games at all. I have no passion for strategy games, I do, however, like the sound of coins jingling as they come out of your pocket. Have a $15 DLC that changes nothing and is worse than the previous game (the black death one).. you will pay for it because you are stupid. Remember how good CK 2 was? Give me your money and I MIGHT, EVENTUALLY make the game like that...  I don't really care to make a good game or one that is even half of the previous one, but give me the money anyway. It's 3d people, that means you should pay me money. The new graphics are worth something right? Hmmm... I might be on to something here.... How about $15 for a few new models of a flag and a cup which give some flat bonuses (a couple of modders could do this work very easily and would have come up with something far more interesting. With a full team I can't believe that this took more than two-three weeks to actually make [if that even! We are talking flags, cups, and stilted idle animations that barely move at all!)... Did I mention I want your money and I don't want to work at making a game? My day is filled with drinking beer and doing nothing because you give me money to do that. Once my beer money starts running out I might code a half-baked mechanic while i'm hungover... I want your money, and I want to do as little as possible to get that money... give me the money. I want to make very, very, very small changes over time so that I don't have to work hard, then 5 years from now (that would be 9 years since release) the game will be like CK2 and you will have to buy all the DLC!!! MONEY, I LOVE THE MONEY, AND I DON'T LIKE TO WORK FOR IT! I don't want to make a good game, I want to make a game that makes you give me money. I hate my player base and I don't care if my game is worse than the previous version. No, I won't fix it for free, give me money. Buy this game instead of the old one because I will make more money. Did I mention the mechanics are half as deep and some are broken... who cares, give me the money. I added boobs into the game guys, real boobs, nips and all! That's worth some money right. Forget that you could mod that in if you wanted to in CK2 (plus who the hell cares anyway! If you want the pr0n0xxx just watch that for free guys), forget about CK2 and it's fully developed mechanics where each culture plays a lot different. That's actually bad game design because I want your money. If I give you a bad game now, and make you pay money to get even to half of what CK2 was that's good for me! Again, I want your money, I don't want to deliver a good product, but I still want your money. Here, take a DLC that is a broken version of IDENTICAL CONTENT FROM CK2... It's better because it is CK 3 instead of 2. Three is bigger than two, right? MONEY. I LOVE MONEY! I LOVE MONEY! I hate work. Excuse me while I go back to thinking about how I can do as little as possible while still getting you to pay for it, but, in reality I'm just going to go count your money instead... even thinking about the game is too much work. Stop expecting a good game guys, geez, game development is soooo hard... maybe a bit more money would motivate me to make an actual game for you.""

This game is worse than CK2 in almost every single way. There is nothing new here. Even with new DLC added it is HALF THE GAME THAT CK2 was. 

I ask you: WHAT IS THE POINT OF BUYING THIS GAME WHEN CK2 IS CHEAPER AND A BIGGER AND A BETTER GAME? Why buy this crap? Don't support the money-grubbing wanna-be pimps.

DON'T SUPPORT THE SCUM MERCHANTS. Don't buy rotting fish at the market, don't buy a rotting game from a dishonest broker. Save your money. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.",False,english,76561198103349403,230.2,2024-09-25 03:01:39

Only three good things are it looks better graphically, integrates -parts- of CK2 DLC into the base game and runs better later into the game. Two of those things come from using a more modern version of their engine and instituting character culling measures that were added late into CK2. There are still major parts of the previous game missing in this game (playable Republics, trade, culturals, bloodlines, societies and others) and there are still a ton of flavorless regions.

Yeah I get it Crusader Kings however, they clearly don't care about that as Crusades are still incredibly dumb, the AI clearly just doesn't know how to coordinate especially with the supply system.

Sure, 30$ might not mean much when you're american and you can probably spend at least 60$ every month with entertainment expenses, but in the case of most of the third world, the price is not properly adapted to our financial realities, most DLC costs more than 10% of my monthly income.

Ignoring that fact, I hate the continuous push for online gameplay.
I'm not an online player. I like to play offline. Alone.
Ultimate Team is kind of addictive and Squad Battles was my favorite mode since it was introduced. Rush sadly is another online mode, adding to the already never ending list of online modes. Squad Battles was the only decent mode for me.
But it seems EA decided to nerf/kill it by decreasing the Squad Battles weekly games from 32 to 14!!!
I can't personally understand the reasoning behind this.
Why does every FC player need to play online? Do I have to rely on Career mode? Or just Kick-off?

Pros:
-Fantastic lore/world building
-Fantastic gameplay
-Huge world with things to do
-Great graphics/art direction
-Phenomenal soundtrack 
-Easy to get into for casual gamers, with plentiful options to make the game significantly easier

Cons:
-PC stuttering caused by shader compilation
-Certain bosses reward good RNG for a run instead of only outplaying them, however every boss is beatable with pure skill alone even if the boss uses their hardest/cheesiest moves. For example beating Malenia felt more like getting a good run than out-skilling her,
-World is vast but does not reward exploration for your specific build (i.e. there's no point in exploring if you already have a build in mind with specific talismans, etc.). Basically if there's nothing you need in a certain area then there's no point going there except for leveling purposes.
-Final boss of the main game is one of the worst main bosses

My Build:
-Melee only strength/stagger build with a two-handed colossal great sword, lion's claw, talismans that boost this playstyle, no summons, no cheesing bosses

The Terry Bogart DLC has just released and the pattern is now clear: They are not trying to create a balanced eSport, but are releasing OP characters to sell DLC!

Every new DLC character release is like a recreation of the Stanford Prison Experiment.  Half the players switch to the new character and get to be wardens, and half the players stick with their main character and get to be prisoners.

Having to fight a constant loop of Terry, Bison, and Akuma is not fun any more.   The only successful DLC characters were Ed and Aki.  They were different enough to attract some attention, but not so overpowered that everyone switched to them.  The pattern with Akuma, Bison, and now Terry is clear.

Allow us to rotate the camera on our chacters. not pan them around just Rotaite the screen. maybe an auto item loot pick up system and a filter out so you only pick up say rare or magic and higher. a way to see which quest we have or havnt compeated. maybe a second hot bar to be switched to. for example you press Alt+2 and your hot bar rotates to your second load out.  guild events for rewards. nothing huge but maybe buffs? but not overpowering buffs but like +12% EXP. or +15% Coin drop you get the idea. maybe a caravan escort mission. I could probably go on. Graphics a decent I really enjoyed the still screen moments. and like I said the storys were well done and had me encrosed. but I like playing side quest and taking my time with storys. OH unlock the horse a little sooner. I get kind of why you dont have it unlock until it does. But it would seem to me that it would entice people to Rush to act 4 faster maybe im wrong.
