Pros:
-Fantastic lore/world building
-Fantastic gameplay
-Huge world with things to do
-Great graphics/art direction
-Phenomenal soundtrack 
-Easy to get into for casual gamers, with plentiful options to make the game significantly easier

Cons:
-PC stuttering caused by shader compilation
-Certain bosses reward good RNG for a run instead of only outplaying them, however every boss is beatable with pure skill alone even if the boss uses their hardest/cheesiest moves. For example beating Malenia felt more like getting a good run than out-skilling her,
-World is vast but does not reward exploration for your specific build (i.e. there's no point in exploring if you already have a build in mind with specific talismans, etc.). Basically if there's nothing you need in a certain area then there's no point going there except for leveling purposes.
-Final boss of the main game is one of the worst main bosses

My Build:
-Melee only strength/stagger build with a two-handed colossal great sword, lion's claw, talismans that boost this playstyle, no summons, no cheesing bosses

The Terry Bogart DLC has just released and the pattern is now clear: They are not trying to create a balanced eSport, but are releasing OP characters to sell DLC!

Every new DLC character release is like a recreation of the Stanford Prison Experiment.  Half the players switch to the new character and get to be wardens, and half the players stick with their main character and get to be prisoners.

Having to fight a constant loop of Terry, Bison, and Akuma is not fun any more.   The only successful DLC characters were Ed and Aki.  They were different enough to attract some attention, but not so overpowered that everyone switched to them.  The pattern with Akuma, Bison, and now Terry is clear.

After finally folding and purchasing the base game at a discount, I quickly grew to love the combat system, methods of gaining power, and especially the story the game told. The most important part of any game to me is the story, followed by the combat mechanics, then the graphics. Cyberpunk smashed all my expectations so much so that I purchased Phantom Liberty at full price when I was halfway through the game, solely because I knew I wanted more content before the end of the game. I'm very glad I did. The DLC has been wonderful, and without spoiling it, I would rate it 2 tiers above the base game (7/10 - base, 9/10 DlC, for an average of 8/10). Note that 5/10 simply means ""average"" and reasonable for the experience/price. I fully recommend the DLC if you enjoyed the base game.",True,english,76561198851611961,0.0,2024-09-22 20:20:17

1. For some reason, when the chase starts and you get hit by a car and continue driving, we did not continue. Our car got pushed to the gate and didn't move. I had to restart.
2. Then when you start fighting scavs, it's needlessly hard. It's my 2nd playthrough, on hard difficulty. On hard, I killed Adam Smasher on 2nd try at just lvl 35 with sucky cyberware, and I'd say Adam Smasher is one of the hardest bosses in the game. This thing took me 5 tries. My advice -- when you get out of car, you get blades. Forget the blades, get back to pistol, find cover and be very careful as they'll shred you very quickly. Be careful with skulls and netrunners. First time I got killed by a runner.
3. After finally doing this, I go to the ""wounded scav"" and... nothing happens. It's bugged again. Trust me, I tried everything and I don't think I did anything unusual to cause it. 

At this point I just lost it. Come on, The DLC had been out for a year now, and the base game is 4 years old at this point. I understand that making games of this scale is hard. Even after 4 years, in the base game content, I still encounter some small bugs but I'm like ""okay, no biggie"".

I was always excited for the npc update and I get that somethings were out of their control such as their servers being stolen years ago or it was wiped I cant exactly remember. This game was a blast and I understand the devs are working hard on the npcs and I hope its worth it, but ive waited over a decade of my life to see semblance of what would change this game forever. They've been dangling this carrot in front of us for over a decade. Its actually wild. At one point npcs were talked about so much that they started muting and banning people over it. I don't blame them. What I do blame them for is how long this has taken. Over a decade really? No transparency until recently. Used to be my favorite devs, now i'm just sad. B42 now to B43, I feel like npcs are never gonna happen. 


Maybe instead of perfecting a decade old game you guys should complete this product and move on to the next with bigger and better ideas. 
Maybe you guys should realize we aren't looking for perfection and looking for more gameplay mechanics to extend the life of this game. 

How about you fix your shit with player feedback?

Or is the code so far gone you are gonna push back the date for eternity or until you tell us its scrapped? 

I'm only saying this out of a place of love for the game you guys have made and as a 
disappointed customer.

To one of my favorite devs to a team I no longer believe in, I sure hope you guys release what you promised over a decade ago.",False,english,76561198055766446,45.25,2024-09-25 05:48:52

I am a huge fan of the 2018 GoW, and this game actually improves on it in nearly every way. I wish that I could be writing a positive review right now, because this game absolutely deserves it... on console.

I bought the steam port the second it came out, and ever since, it has been fundamentally broken. I have no idea why most other reviewers aren't commenting on this, but this port is unplayable as it stands. I can repeatedly cause it to crash to desktop simply by looking at the in-game menus. If you want to read the in game lore, the game will crash the second you select any other item than the one it initially opened on, eg. Kvasir's Poems. The game also crashes during certain fights seemingly at random. And all of this will occur after closing the game and reopening to play later from your last save, which is a very normal thing to do.

I am running the game on an asus zephyrus laptop, with a 3080 gpu, as well as 8gb of vram. I am well within the bounds of recommended specs, and run intensive games all the time with no problems whatsoever. I have tried almost every combination of settings, both in and out of the game, but to no avail. I have scoured what little there is online, and amazingly, turning it off and on again doesn't fix an in-game bug, or bugs.

I have to imagine that all the good reviews are from people who haven't picked up this game since the first time opening it, or who have only played it on console. When this bug, or bugs, is fixed, I will immediately come back and edit this review to be glowing. But in the meantime, I encourage everyone to stay far away until it is fixed, and play the console version instead.",False,english,76561198182899495,12.533333333333333,2024-09-25 04:44:06

People may complain about the Ironwood section and while it was the weakest part of the game, it was still an enjoyable experience.

I have gotten to the mission with Atreus and [spoiler]Angrboda[/spoiler] and I have to take a break from this game as this mission in particular is a pungent combination of every aspect that makes this game so awful...

[*] The game features an Incredibly drawn out level design that forcefully diverts attention from the main objective without creating any sort of interest in whatever else that's going on. 
[*] The dialogue/voice acting takes away from the immersion of the mission and rarely adds anything of substance to the world (Sindri, Brock, and a few others are exceptions to this). 
[*] The combat system feels inconsistent and fights including bosses feel less ""cool"" then in the other games. 
[*] The puzzles/path discovery needed to advance within missions feels redundant, unoriginal, and often times unnecessary. 
[*] And IMO the armor/weapon upgrade UI feels unrefined and outdated. 

These issues are dramatically present in the mission mentioned above but are featured throughout the ~9 hours of gameplay I've experienced so far.

On the plus side the graphics and cut scenes look amazing, and the main story so far is awesome, in spite of how hard the developers tried to destroy the interesting aspects of the story through an incredibly poorly thought out gameplay experience. 

IMO this game is nowhere near worth the $60 price tag and I heavily regret spending that amount on this game. I would seriously wait for it to go on sale somewhere below the $30 mark. 

I will most likely end up completing the main story, just for nostalgias sake, and immediately uninstall it.",False,english,76561198106538476,8.566666666666666,2024-09-24 21:49:59

However, there are several things that weigh the experience down. The story forcing you to load into quests solo, watch the unskippable cutscene, then have you or your friend leave their instance in order to play together is a major pain point. The lack of  proper weapon tutorials hurts on-boarding for new players, as they need to consult third party guides just to understand how their weapon functions. Menus are annoying at best and unintuitive at worst. While most of the issues I've mentioned so far are minor in the grand scheme of things, a major gripe I have with the game has to do with the unequal treatment of weapons in regard to dealing elemental damage. Having half of your arsenal be objectively inferior to just using a weapon with more raw damage hurts build diversity, and is incredibly disappointing when you want to build around a monster's weakness, only to end up doing worse because your weapon isn't good for elemental damage.

Pros:
* Amazing cutscenes
* Decent story for a Monster Hunter game
* The weapons feel good to use (at least the ones I tried)
* Most of the new monsters have great designs and fights
* The mantles are a decent new addition

Cons:
* The clutch claw is not only janky with nonsensacle physics, it is necessary to beat most late game monsters in iceborne if you're playing alone and it made my favorite weapon type (Dual blades) unusable until the post game of the DLC without making insane builds for each monster
* Cutscenes are unskippable even on a second playthrough and make playing through the game with friends a nightmare with how they're implemented
* Most of the weapon designs not only look like trash, they don't even match the respective armor well
