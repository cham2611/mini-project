Not too familiar with it personally, so it was a nice breath of fresh air. 

The combat is fun and there's a lot of build variety. Sometimes the controls can feel a bit janky (feels like commands aren't queued up properly if your character is busy in an animation so it feels like you have to spam buttons to get one command out sometimes).

The story was relatively interesting. The end chapter animations were a huge highlight and a wonderful little decompression moment after the (usually) intense chapter end bosses.

Areas looked very beautiful but I definitely felt like level design itself was a bit lacking (even if the environments were gorgeous). Some areas dragged on for far too long and were kind of samey (chapter 5 really felt like it would never end). 

Overall, I definitely enjoyed the game and felt like the time I spent with it was worth it. I'm looking forward to the DLC.

After finally folding and purchasing the base game at a discount, I quickly grew to love the combat system, methods of gaining power, and especially the story the game told. The most important part of any game to me is the story, followed by the combat mechanics, then the graphics. Cyberpunk smashed all my expectations so much so that I purchased Phantom Liberty at full price when I was halfway through the game, solely because I knew I wanted more content before the end of the game. I'm very glad I did. The DLC has been wonderful, and without spoiling it, I would rate it 2 tiers above the base game (7/10 - base, 9/10 DlC, for an average of 8/10). Note that 5/10 simply means ""average"" and reasonable for the experience/price. I fully recommend the DLC if you enjoyed the base game.",True,english,76561198851611961,0.0,2024-09-22 20:20:17

1. For some reason, when the chase starts and you get hit by a car and continue driving, we did not continue. Our car got pushed to the gate and didn't move. I had to restart.
2. Then when you start fighting scavs, it's needlessly hard. It's my 2nd playthrough, on hard difficulty. On hard, I killed Adam Smasher on 2nd try at just lvl 35 with sucky cyberware, and I'd say Adam Smasher is one of the hardest bosses in the game. This thing took me 5 tries. My advice -- when you get out of car, you get blades. Forget the blades, get back to pistol, find cover and be very careful as they'll shred you very quickly. Be careful with skulls and netrunners. First time I got killed by a runner.
3. After finally doing this, I go to the ""wounded scav"" and... nothing happens. It's bugged again. Trust me, I tried everything and I don't think I did anything unusual to cause it. 

At this point I just lost it. Come on, The DLC had been out for a year now, and the base game is 4 years old at this point. I understand that making games of this scale is hard. Even after 4 years, in the base game content, I still encounter some small bugs but I'm like ""okay, no biggie"".

I am a huge fan of the 2018 GoW, and this game actually improves on it in nearly every way. I wish that I could be writing a positive review right now, because this game absolutely deserves it... on console.

I bought the steam port the second it came out, and ever since, it has been fundamentally broken. I have no idea why most other reviewers aren't commenting on this, but this port is unplayable as it stands. I can repeatedly cause it to crash to desktop simply by looking at the in-game menus. If you want to read the in game lore, the game will crash the second you select any other item than the one it initially opened on, eg. Kvasir's Poems. The game also crashes during certain fights seemingly at random. And all of this will occur after closing the game and reopening to play later from your last save, which is a very normal thing to do.

I am running the game on an asus zephyrus laptop, with a 3080 gpu, as well as 8gb of vram.

I have gotten to the mission with Atreus and [spoiler]Angrboda[/spoiler] and I have to take a break from this game as this mission in particular is a pungent combination of every aspect that makes this game so awful...

[*] The game features an Incredibly drawn out level design that forcefully diverts attention from the main objective without creating any sort of interest in whatever else that's going on. 
[*] The dialogue/voice acting takes away from the immersion of the mission and rarely adds anything of substance to the world (Sindri, Brock, and a few others are exceptions to this). 
[*] The combat system feels inconsistent and fights including bosses feel less ""cool"" then in the other games. 
[*] The puzzles/path discovery needed to advance within missions feels redundant, unoriginal, and often times unnecessary. 
[*] And IMO the armor/weapon upgrade UI feels unrefined and outdated. 

These issues are dramatically present in the mission mentioned above but are featured throughout the ~9 hours of gameplay I've experienced so far.

On the plus side the graphics and cut scenes look amazing, and the main story so far is awesome, in spite of how hard the developers tried to destroy the interesting aspects of the story through an incredibly poorly thought out gameplay experience.

It's very slow moving story wise with loads of places where you can only move your character around slowly in game. I usually love games with loads of interaction between characters but so much of the dialogue is bad and dull that this is one of the few games where I want to skip scenes. Worst of all for me though is that there are permanently missable items, such as a materia at the start of the game that you can never get again if you miss it. That's just bad design.

Combat is fine. There is an option for letting your guys auto attack so you can focus on commands but if you do that battles take soooooooo long whereas they go fast if you just mash x. I can see what they were trying to do and it looks cool to watch but playing it feels unfocused and you because everything is in such frenetic action, you can't appreciate the art assets or models at all

Until today the story and characters stuck on my mind and feel like family. Now that I started playing FF7 Remake for nearly 10 hours, I need to say that this game is just awesome! You need to adopt that they added some side arcs and more depth to the characters that hadn't been there in the beginning but if you're an open minded person this add so much value to the story. I didn't think after all that critizism that I'd say that, but I love the changes and love even more to see that 95% stayed the same. Awesome!

Beyond well optimized. Its easily one of my favorite games to play right now.

Aside from running well, this game has been everything I wanted it to be and then some. Compared to the vibe of original FF7, I think this does it a lot of justice. The characters and dialogue are fun, the Shinra menace is equally pronounced etc.

The combat is so smooth I don't even know where to start. But somehow they made a turn-based FF game feel completely naturally FF in an action RPG environment. It's great.

The pacing is good, the side quests are cute and rewarding. I feel like I wasn't wasting much time if any in this game. Everything just sorta flows when you figure out the map.

I can praise this game all day. I'm on the last chapter as of today - I only have a few issues:

-The humor can be out of place sometimes along with the fan service. Particularly when you hear Tifa say 'Man I really need a shower' for the 40th time after a fight it sorta makes you raise an eyebrow, genuinely. That crap is NOT why I'm here and it's sad to me that these adults designing these games find it adds anything to this kinda game.

-I get there is world building and the game GENUINELY at times feels like a re-imagined PS1 game but at times I feel like I'm running down long hallways for no real reason. Are the narrow passages you have to side-step through like...loading screens? Some places are just too big dude. 

-Collect-a-thon. As much as I like that and enjoy it in FF games, this game goes a little too far with the ground clutter. Way too many boxes to destroy. Personally I prefer ~80% of my items to be bought/earned from fights but I'd reckon 70-80% of your important items are in yellow-lit boxes and the battle rewards are mostly for gil. Is what it is. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I would probably enjoy *an hour or 2* Less destroying boxes on the ground.",True,english,76561197995229830,39.11666666666667,2024-09-22 20:25:37

It feels more fluid, yet I can access the menu to choose what I want to do for the character I'm controlling. Is it complete control over all the characters with ATB? No. However, for this remake, it feels right. Moving onto changes in the story. There are a lot I agree with, and it was nice to have a change. However, I also felt a lot didn't need a change. That is my opinion, and you must make up your own. It's still a fantastic game, and I love it.",True,english,76561198933387046,41.65,2024-09-22 08:09:28

- Combat gets interruped every five second because camera gotta zoom on enemy charging attack.
- Knockbacks are insane every time you get close they knock you back and they can lead to combos just becouse.
- Even if you manage to hit enemy they just automatically counter deal damage to you and send you away again.
- Party members are awful they do just bare minimum, they live long enough just becouse enemy mostly targets only character currenty controlled by player.(Also same useless character blows in next cinematic fifty ton boulder with lightning. That just makes me scream.)
- Dodge got no i frames it only avoids aoe and projectiles in melee vs bosses is pretty much useless.
- Attacks cannot be cancelled probably biggest turnback issue i have no idea why but we can only watch next three seconds getting hit and have no other option.
- I did it in second try and the WORST thing is i dont even know how..

What really got AC going for me was and still is the replay feature. There's just something magic to leaning back in your chair and enjoying the mayhem you've brought onto your objectives.

The most realistic parts of this game and series as a whole:
- The look of the aircraft, ordinance, and effects.
- Some of the atmospheric effects: weather, vector trails, vapour, albeit no contrails above FL300ish as of yet.
- The diversity in aircraft types.
- The air battle management dialogue and presentation, which is fairly well depicted for a video game. It's clear that they consulted with real Tactical Air Traffic controllers on some level.
- The depiction of Tactical Data Link in a practical sense, especially with regard to ID classification.
- Playtime WRT length of missions.
- Plot points such as electronic warfare, drones, AI.
The least realistic parts:
- Let's be honest, ammunition load-out storage. Ridiculous. But the missions would be 5 minutes long, force you to land and take off repeatedly, or only have a couple land targets and a single enemy fighter group otherwise.
- Mechanics of fighter jet flight. Totally ridiculous. But fun and arcade-esque.
- Mechanics of air weapon flight. Ridiculous to keep up with the aircraft they are targeting. Fair enough.
- Fidelity of radar, comms, and link coverage. Not realistic for things to just work perfectly everywhere always. Just a game though.
- Plot points such as gigantic aircraft carriers, rail guns, and space elevators. Too expensive in the real world to ever make sense. Alluring as a fantasy depiction for sure.
- Pilot response to the ridiculous acceleration/deceleration and +/-G forces. That is not at all depicted in the series during gameplay. However it is mentioned in cutscenes.
- Supersonic depiction, something that I have only seen accurately depicted in flight simulator.
- It would be cool to have an depiction of Mach, IAS, and TAS if not for pure effect.
- It would be cool to have the cockpit depict information completely much like the VR presentation.

If I missed anything... well you'll see. I highly recommend any game in this series. This is the best seller for a reason but the story is a little more compelling in AC4 and its subsequent releases. Hopefully one day we will get remakes and remasters because these games have a lot of replayability and the older titles are kind of forgotten given their generation. The developers don't have to improve too much to keep fans happy, aside from a better multiplayer experience and some minor touch-ups, such as inaccurate sound effects and a storyline that isn't really very sad.",True,english,76561198155871425,6.183333333333334,2024-09-21 14:21:36

The strong point of the game, it does well what FFXV did poorly but despite that the magic system is still inferior to the rest of the series, not as bad as the one in FF XV but VII Remake and Lightning Returns are better action FFs in their magic system, if you liked DMC V and likes FF you're still going to like the gameplay.

Maps
Noting really impressive, the game is actually better in the corridor sections than in their multiple big areas, but nothing  quite as good as the secrets or freedom that you have in FF XII, it doesn't help that there are fell dungeons and that they are locked behind the story(you can replay them at any moment).

Story
Despite the good start the story is probably the worst I have experienced in a FF game, it tries to be too serious but the western style storytelling doesn't fit with the themes of a FF story, Clive is an adult that acts like a depressive teenager, the game tries to make you fell sympathy for what the characters had to go through but it just fell forced, like the fact the protagonist was ""forced"" into slavery for 13 years, and it's not just slavery that felt forced, one moment you are invading a country and another you are helping a whore protect a city? there is a good lore to make things interesting but they didn't know what to focus and ended up half-assing everything.
If the game didn't have so many side stories and focused more on the main cast like FF XV did it would had been a lot better but it ends up taking the story too serious for what it is.

I would recommend the game if there was less story but because the game has so many cutscenes it's hard to separate it from the game, there are good moments but the bad ones are really bad, at least we the gameplay carries the game for me.",False,english,76561198246410412,69.81666666666666,2024-09-25 04:53:51

Koji-Fox, come back, we miss you and your jokes. And we don't want Poochie anymore.

I was pulled into FFXVI's world in a way that XIII and XV both failed to. I can see so much of FFXIV's influence not just in the excellent production and storytelling, but in the game's refusal to waste your time for no reason. i.e. Once you've been somewhere you can fast-travel there, *optional* side-quests along the way, rewards for just playing through, clearly marking side-quests that are special, etc.

Can't say enough about the sound, it's fantastic. Whether it's the music, sound effects, or the (English) voice acting, it's clear that it got a lot of attention.

Graphics are gorgeous. Easily one of the best looking games on PC today. Very much glad to have waited to play this title on PC.

Game play is pretty much on the same direction as XV. If you don't like action combat, well... then it's not for you. I loved FF: Stranger of Paradise, and I like FFXVI's system. While this is nowhere near as punishing, it can still offer a reasonable challenge. At the same time, it actually has difficulty settings and the ability to further reduce challenge, if desired, via special accessories you get out of the gate. Skill system is fine IMO, let's you customize the way you like to play without giving you a full-blown autistic PoE-style circuit to deal with.

Story? It's dark, depressing, but very well-told some 18 hours in at this point. Tons of lore to explore and flesh out the world for those interested. But it is not necessary to study in-game lore to enjoy the story. If you like immersing yourself in your game's world, it's there for you. Otherwise, they don't waste your time by forcing you to read it.

The people complaining that it's not a true FF game because it isn't turn-based need to get real... I'd wager some few of them were probably the same ones bagging on Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon for ""being behind the times"" and still having turn-based, menu-driven, combat systems when those titles came out ~17 years ago.

Also, it has a free demo. If you're not sure that FFXVI is your cup of tea, try the demo. Your opinion is worth way more than mine when it comes to spending your own $50. And it's damn sure worth more than xXStrifeCloudiroth420Xx's retard-tier take that it's bad because Final Fantasy peaked in 1997.

As far as this current game it is a must play. It does take longer than what many say unless you rush it. the video quality is excellent, voice acting is great, the battle system is good long as long as you tune your magics right for the fight.

You want to get to the next part of the gang's ""big plan"" but first you need to get through an hour long filler arc between actual plot continuity, you could easily cut a third of the game's runtime worth of redundant cutscenes and five to 50 meter walking sections to trigger another cutscene.",False,english,76561198143774290,16.066666666666666,2024-09-25 00:18:11

The game is visually stunning, especially in some of the story's big moments. The graphics are certainly up-to-date and look absolutely wonderful.
In terms of combat, it's a gradually-unfolding library of abilities and options that doesn't stop pouring more and more depth out to the player, which I can safely assume doesn't stop throughout the course of the game's entire story. I haven't finished the game, being only 24 hours into it, but I can safely say that the way things are structured lets you know that you'll never be at a loss for more new powers and attacks to use. I  would say the combat in this game strays from the usual of this franchise, and the developers opted for real-time button-masher slice-and-dice type of combat instead of the turn-based JRPG combat. Some similarities I can safely make are the God of War franchise and the Devil May Cry franchise, where you have a vast array of skills you can chain together in intense, fast-paced slash-and-dash combat. As I mentioned before, the combat capabilities of both Clive and his companions increases constantly throughout the game's main story campaign, starting off somewhat limited and slower-paced, with not much potential for chaining abilities or juggling an enemy with combos. However, later during the game, many options are presented to you and you can craft your own array of powers to channel depending on what you like best.

There is a skill tree, although it is much more simplistic and very surface-level compared to other games in the genre. I find this to be a positive, as I would much rather spend my time playing the game than stuck in the menus trying to navigate a digital library of damage and armor numbers.

The story is absolutely enthralling, with a lovable cast of characters each with their own personalities and personal stories. Clive is a wonderful protagonist with an incredible voice actor and a perfectly-structured list of motivations that shifts in a very sensible and relatable way throughout the game's story. You get to see the entire tale unfold right from the beginning and even from other characters' perspectives at times.
I would draw a comparison between this and George R.R Martin's Game of Thrones, as the political aspects of the world's nations and interactions between their powerful figures, their plots and their schemes, intertwines with the fantastical nature of FFXVI's realm to create a very, very immersive story.

This is only my second Final Fantasy game, having only played FF15 before this. I can easily say that this time around, the game's story and worldbuilding is on an entirely different level of maturity. It is darker, grittier, and more brutal, and the game does a great job expressing this in its cutscenes, the carefully-designed environments, and the dialogue of the characters. There is even an NPC that comes up during the main story, which educates the protagonist on the state of the world, really delivering more information and lore to the player as part of a collection of entertaining cutscenes.

This game's boss fights are some of the most epic and memorable I've seen in any video game. There are amazing massive-scale fights that feel almost addictive, and really spark a flame of that power fantasy for the player. I can't say any more without spoilers, but if you're looking for some visually-stunning large-scale boss fights, you can't do much better than this game, save for maybe the God of War franchise or Shadow of the Colossus.

As for performance, I am running this on an i9 with a 3060ti and 32gb ram. The game runs very smoothly often times for me, with a bit of roughness on day 1 of PC release. My computer restarted a few times when playing this game, but that issue has faded away entirely. Over the course of my 24 hours of gameplay, I've experienced only 1 or 2 second-long brief patches of FPS loss, which did not happen very often. Maybe once or twice per session, during the particularly weighty moments where there was alot to see on-screen.

The only problems with this game are as follows:

I find the pacing to be rather slow between the big main story moments. It's fine and dandy to run around doing normal things every once in a while, but sometimes it drags out a tiny bit and it feels a little like a chore. Despite this, the game's story uses the time it is given by the slow pacing to further flesh out the characters. Turning the bad into good, I suppose - I like it :)

Loot - the game throws out new weapons, armor pieces and accesories at you, which have their own numbers and effects that can be pretty interesting. However, there isn't really any time during the game where you'd defeat an enemy and your jaw would drop because you got a rare piece of loot, that kind of joy isn't made available by this game, unfortunately. The weapons do change the visuals of Clive's sword, but mechanically, all they change is a number. It would've been nice to see some of the weapons or armor pieces being a little bit more involved in combat than simply changing around the number of damage you do in a hit, or how much HP you have, and such.

There is little in the way of customization. At some point in the game, you do gain the ability to change Clive and his companions' appearance, by selecting one of some outfits that are made available to you. I find this extremely limited, and I'd love the ability to change around individual pieces of Clive's armor. That's alot to ask for, so I'd settle for just a few more outfits to be made available in the game. FF15 was the same way, but that one had quite a few more options than FF16.

That's all I can say for this game. I can see myself playing it all the way through and I'm super excited for everything that comes next :)
That being said, my rating for this game is a solid 9/10. If you're a fan of hacking and slashing through enemies, navigating a fantastical world with carefully-designed environments, and being immersed in a wonderful and interpersonal story, FFXVI is the game for you",True,english,76561199095385764,24.866666666666667,2024-09-24 20:51:52
