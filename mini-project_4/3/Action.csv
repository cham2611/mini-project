HOWEVER, the biggest concern is the servers they have. Right now there's only realistically 4-5 servers running and I hear EU servers arent always up and if you're like me who lives in Australia which needs a Oceania server which doesnt exist then you're looking about 250 ping to play which lags liike crazy on Asia & US server.
Will change to a thumbs up once they've added new servers in hopefully this game continues to grow as I have high hopes for it!

UPDATE: Pretty disappointed at how the management is with this game as they try to do a lot of banning and not to mention banning stream snipers instead of focusing more time on actually trying to open new servers up so to get more exposure for the game.....Right now it's kind of a turn off so decided to uninstall it.

Pros:
-Fantastic lore/world building
-Fantastic gameplay
-Huge world with things to do
-Great graphics/art direction
-Phenomenal soundtrack 
-Easy to get into for casual gamers, with plentiful options to make the game significantly easier

Cons:
-PC stuttering caused by shader compilation
-Certain bosses reward good RNG for a run instead of only outplaying them, however every boss is beatable with pure skill alone even if the boss uses their hardest/cheesiest moves. For example beating Malenia felt more like getting a good run than out-skilling her,
-World is vast but does not reward exploration for your specific build (i.e. there's no point in exploring if you already have a build in mind with specific talismans, etc.). Basically if there's nothing you need in a certain area then there's no point going there except for leveling purposes.
-Final boss of the main game is one of the worst main bosses

My Build:
-Melee only strength/stagger build with a two-handed colossal great sword, lion's claw, talismans that boost this playstyle, no summons, no cheesing bosses

Not too familiar with it personally, so it was a nice breath of fresh air. 

The combat is fun and there's a lot of build variety. Sometimes the controls can feel a bit janky (feels like commands aren't queued up properly if your character is busy in an animation so it feels like you have to spam buttons to get one command out sometimes).

The story was relatively interesting. The end chapter animations were a huge highlight and a wonderful little decompression moment after the (usually) intense chapter end bosses.

Areas looked very beautiful but I definitely felt like level design itself was a bit lacking (even if the environments were gorgeous). Some areas dragged on for far too long and were kind of samey (chapter 5 really felt like it would never end). 

Overall, I definitely enjoyed the game and felt like the time I spent with it was worth it. I'm looking forward to the DLC.

The Terry Bogart DLC has just released and the pattern is now clear: They are not trying to create a balanced eSport, but are releasing OP characters to sell DLC!

Every new DLC character release is like a recreation of the Stanford Prison Experiment.  Half the players switch to the new character and get to be wardens, and half the players stick with their main character and get to be prisoners.

Having to fight a constant loop of Terry, Bison, and Akuma is not fun any more.   The only successful DLC characters were Ed and Aki.  They were different enough to attract some attention, but not so overpowered that everyone switched to them.  The pattern with Akuma, Bison, and now Terry is clear.

The Game is pretty fun, but while I personally have enjoyed the game when it's working, be warned that at this point there are some issues that are still getting ironed out.

-Sometimes has good stability, but other times crashes at the end of every round.
-Poor performance issues (The Devs have already addressed this, although my frame-rate smoothed out inexplicably after playing for an hour or two.)
-Character movement sometimes has you bouncing in place as you try and escape from danger, alongside being rather sluggish at times.

There's also the Elephant in the room; the base water mechanic.
While I personally don't find it to be an egregious problem - and indeed, appreciate the aspects the Developers wanted to add from this system - I don't think its current implementation is the best way it could have been done.
In my eyes, it's somewhat tricky to have a system like this, where players are almost required to ""babysit"" the game - and can potentially loose all their progress for simply not playing for a period of time. 

This mechanic has been attributed as being one of the ""Hardcore"" elements of the game, however the most common argument of those supporting its presence is, typically, that collecting water isn't difficult- and can be done relatively easy - ensuring that a player isn't forced to spend hours each day just to upkeep their in-game progress...
But since this *is* the case, the urgency of the water-mechanic, and its entire purpose is effectively undermined by the very ease of collecting water, thus diminishing it's ""Hardcore"" aspect.

The most probable solution to this issue would likely be adjusting water to simply be consumed either at a flat-rate while in-game, (adjusting water provided per canister to probably like 1-2 hours per unit of water) or alternatively having water be spent as a metaphorical ""fuel source"" to go on scavenging runs, with more hazardous or distant locations requiring more water.

I've been excited about it for awhile now and I am happy to report that it's exactly what I wanted. I know it's still in early development, but what they have so far is hands down the best extraction shooter I've ever played.

Pros: 
GREAT atmosphere! this is the best part in my opinion. The grim dark world they put you in is really cool and I like it alot. 

Awesome weapons! I really like how all the guns feel and you really don't want to loose the good ones once you get them. 

Great gameplay loop. 

lots of loot and customization. 

Cons:

AI compainions are derpy and I wouldn't waste my time with them yet. 

Some stuttering graphically, but that's to be expected. It runs great for me on ultra with no crashes so far.

Movement is clunky, you get stuck into everything, rocks, debris, even flat ground has odd collisions that gets you stuck and killed. The different movement speed between walking forward and sideways feels off, I understand the sprint forward goes faster thing but when walking it just feels bad.

Movement and stealth systems are not fleshed out enough for such an oppressive environment. Being able to prone, execute unaware enemies or even dropping your rig to fight then pick it back up later (Akin to Outwards), would be amazing additions.

The enemy perception is a bit inconsistent, sometimes they don't see you 2 meters away from their faces, sometimes they spot you instantly.

Not being able to play online either, all lobbies show 9999 ping and fails to join all of them.

My verdict is that they need to focus on the core of the game before the looks, get the anim BPs working fluidly, get the interactions to be more consistent, fix the collisions on the terrain. A game is mainly help up by its game-play first, graphics and atmosphere second.

It's early access and very much an unpolished gem; the environments are gorgeous works of post apocalyptic horror and even in the tutorial the tutorial mobs are very scary as they lurch and lunge forward trying to gorge your flesh out, but the entire game is currently not very well optimized to handle these areas. I'm running a 4070 and this game uses 99% of my GPU to barely hit 45-50 frames, the enemy AI is currently very rough with them standing still, looking at each other and not moving or just flat out freezing from time to time (I even saw a tank get kicked over by a massive mech and then right itself by just suddenly flipping) but the battles between them do feel very real and very fun to watch from afar. My only gripes about gameplay I believe will be fixed with time, those being the water system depleting when you are out of the game in real time, the fact that enemy corpses despawn very quickly (some even in front of my eyes) which seems contradictory to the stance of the devs that you should get used to looting already dead bodies rather than making them yourself, and I already found an item duplication bug that lets you take as many of an item as you want and also doesn't add any extra weight to your character. I truly believe that after a few months this game will be a very fun play, and I haven't died a single time after going through 5 raids on 3 of the available, not without a couple bullet holes in my ass as I've scurried away from any fight the game tried to lure me into, and the character progression along with the quests let you level up your character very fast but I most likely won't be playing this solo because it honestly seems more fun with friends.",True,english,76561198155571261,1.2833333333333334,2024-09-25 04:36:19

There are several gamebreaking bugs and some annoying map glitches, but that does not detract from the fun to the point where you would quit the game altogether. What might make you ragequit though, is the insane difficulty at play. It is a brutal struggle to extract, and getting water is a real challenge. The AI will kill you without a moments thought, so stealthing around is a must. You can follow behind titanic war machines and loot the bodies of their enemies, as long as you do not get hit in the cross fire. All in all, this is a game with serious potential, and I hope the developers do well. If not I will go back to touching grass.",True,english,76561199574797483,2.7666666666666666,2024-09-25 04:35:57

Doesn't excuse the other problems though. 

The spawns and AI behavior are abysmal to say the least. Enemies will actively ignore each other and aggro you specifically if you're in their line of sight. Even going so far as to charging down the same trench to get at you. Not to mention the game will periodically spawn enemies in extremely close proximity to you, often leading to death either by the enemies dropped on your head or by the other enemies that aggro to your location because of the spawn. Even more annoying is when you spend a solid twenty minutes memorizing patrol routes and timing in order to figure out the best path to take to get to loot areas, only for some random unit to change its patrol pattern at the drop of a hat and corner you in an area you though was safe. Honestly, half the time it feels more like your success is determined by luck more than anything at which point I would advise the lottery. At least you can get real money out of that. 

On top of that, there is a rather blatant disconnect between the the games design and the mechanics therein. Most common is the HK mechanic. I don't know what exactly triggers them to come after you since they've occasionally spawned in before I even grabbed any loot, but from then on they will hunt you down and you cannot lose them. run all you like but the game puts a tracker on your rig, out of thin air mind you, that transmits your location to the hunter killers at all times, making evasion, ambushes, and tactics completely useless. This would, seemingly, leave you with two options; fight in a game that discourages fighting and will punish you for it, or run for the exit and hope nothing spawns in your way.  And to those who figure they can take the risk of the former option, let me make myself perfectly clear. I tried that. I had 3 rounds left when it was over. The game then spawned a new batch in to keep chasing me. Though it did teach me that Ashen Mesa is a good place to test out speed running tactics.

Even more egregious is the Night Shift. I don't know what the devs were thinking when they made this map variant but, unless you want to have a horde shooter, in a game that is designed to be the antithesis of a horde shooter in every way, stay away from the Night Shift. The game outright saturates maps with cyborg zombies and a single bullet will trigger every one of them. It doesn't exactly help that this map variant appears at random thus leaving you with no way to prepare for it. It honestly makes me question if the devs actually know what kind of game they're trying to make.

However, the devs have decided that water, the most important resource in the game (as it allows your underground community to flourish and grow, including adding new vendors to shop from), will be consumed in real time. Whether you are playing or not. And should you run out of water while you're at dinner with your family, or visiting your sick grandma in the hospital? All your progress. Gone. Vendors, gone. Guns, gone. Everything, gone.

Their stated reason is that they want you to be anxious about your resources, even if you're off your pc and touching grass. They want you constantly thinking about the game. And in order to make the collection of water less ""tedious"", they've just decided to make water plentiful and easy to get, which is...antithetical to the entire idea??

No thanks, devs. I've refunded the game, and I won't be coming back until you do the right thing and get rid of this FOMO lite practice. I have other games I want to play, and I have other things in my life I want to do without having to essentially be dragged back by force just to ensure my hard work isn't arbitrarily deleted.

However, that does not mean I think the presentation is bad.

Right now this is very early access, if you're okay with that, then take a look, but some things that should be pointed at are: 

1. The AI
 - The AI is stupid and buggy, it can go from hyper-aware to hyper-unaware very quickly.

2. The Water System
 - What can I say that hasn't been said already? At first I thought it was neat, but thinking about it, it's not fun for people who aren't hardcore losers like some of us. 

3. Optimization
 - Again, quick summary, it's okay to run, but it can tank in some areas depending on the computer. I'm personally running a 3060 with a Ryzen 5 3600.

4. Combat 
 - Combat is clunky and the movement can be frustrating at times. The guns feel disproportionate to the damage they are doing, (i.e. shotgun feels weak but can one-shot enemies), and the character model is a huge part of the screen. 

In the end, I think that this game is early access and has lots of time to improve. I would only say that you purchase this game if you understand the issues of an early access game and you understand that (hopefully) these things will be improved on in the future. I am a huge fan of the movie Mad God so this game was a natural purchase, and it REALLY does a good job at that, it makes me feel like I'm in a cold, hellish environment, and I will commend it for that. Though, I cannot recommend this to someone who does not already have interest in supporting the devs or that has the patience to wait for the game to develop it more. Please, and I seriously mean, please, understand that this game is early access and this was released by the public's request.
