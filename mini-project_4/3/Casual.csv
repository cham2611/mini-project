Pros:
- Stunning scenes with adaptive lighting, bloom, focus blur, and filters. Combine it with camera work and it's a marvel of game visuals.
- Lots of customization options.
- Calming BGM + satisfying ASMR SFX. Even as you hover over colors to pick, there are singular xylophone sounds playing with each option.
- Highly adaptive procedural adaptations as well as decorative nuances. Bird nests popping up in roof creases and sheeps floating with umbrellas being my cherries-on-top.
- No visible limiting grid, or as they'd say, 'gridless.'
- Very low price compared to what it offers.
- Demo save transfers well into the full game.

Some introductory tutorials in sandbox games can be invasive and interrupting a smooth gameplay, especially if you skip it or will miss something major if you do. This game isn't about that.

You're welcome to explore on your own what this droplet button does, what dragging this wall sideways will do, what will happen if you choose to put three windows together, etc. With the vast customization and options, I find that in my first 3 hours of playing, I keep learning new things non-stop.

You're not spoon-fed with rules, told to run tasks, follow a story, or even taught how to do things - instead, you adapt on your own, just like how the game adapts to what little changes you do. You make the glade feel like home, and the game gladly returns the favor, creating a flourishing mutualistic ecosystem and the humbling sandbox experience that the game is.

Bugs found:
- Certain bugs for item positioning/adaptation. Ex: ivy remains floating in the air from removed/shrunk buildings.
- Camera bugs. Ex: camera got stuck in one zoomed angle, can still move but always returns to the stuck angle. Restarting the game resets it and no progress were lost.

Suggestions for developers to add:

- Options to group objects together
- Controls to lock & unlock objects from moving or changing
- Controls to copy, cut, and paste objects/group of objects
- Options to pick and drop color, also to color multiple objects at once
- Options to enable interactive humans/humanoid characters to inhabit or explore glades the way wild animals do
- Additional water/terrain option: automatic square or circular shape in addition to the manual drawing option
- Additional delete option: wipe the entire scene out of trees, buildings, etc with just one click
- Options to manually add furniture/items for decor aside from automatic procedural adaptations
- Options to generate bridges with different styles (as opposed to people manually making it with building tricks)
- Options to generate stairs with different styles (as opposed to people also manually making it with building tricks)
- Options to generate moving water like rivers or waterfalls.
- Options to generate more terrain items like stones, logs, stumps, as well as more variation of flowers and plants.
- Additional options to change the weather, i.e cloudy, raining, etc
- And ofc more choice for scenes & building styles, perhaps some that captures dark gothic aesthetic or eastern/oriental style designs if that already hasn't been in development (highly suspect it has)

Aside from how well-developed this game already is, I really appreciate how well-loved it is too, both by the players and developers. This seems like a game my past younger self, my current self, and my future elderly self, all would love to play regardless of time and relevance.

The charm of the historic cobblestone streets, flower pots in the windows, perfect little gardens in it all. The meadows where the cows pass through, the bells around their necks ring.

I have been waiting for this game to come out for quite some time, the simple relaxing nature of the tiny glade drew me in for a chill gaming experience, I was not disappointed. Its a charming and creative experience for when you don't want a shooter or strategy game. Its a good way to unwind after a long day, something to do when you want to express your creativity, or you just want to escape to your little slice of peaceful bliss. Don't expect to ""win"" or ""lose"" in this game, there is no victory conditions, just build a castle or what once was a castle, build a farm, a town, or a village, its up to your interpretation. I do wish the glade wasn't so... tiny, and I wish you could control, move, and spawn more animals, but its a small nitpick.

Its a game that can take you somewhere new, or back in time, or so it feels. I may not be 7 anymore, I'm an adult with responsibilities, people that depend on me, a day that is filled with more busy time than free time, but for now, I'm just going to forget about all of that, and go back to when life was simpler, at least for 5 more minutes.",True,english,76561198019158913,2.4,2024-09-25 04:09:41

Beat up your friends and family in spectacular fashion by throwing bombs, hitting them with a shovel, punching them in the face, smacking them or yourself with nunchucks or tasing them with a taser. Do all of this while looking like the most adorable little evil menace that you can customize to your liking. 

Had enough of the team beatup game for a bit? Try the coop pirate mode where you have to fend of a bunch of pirates with your friends or maybe try one of the team game modes like football, hockey or american football. Looking for something different than smashing enemies? Maybe the winter cabin mode is better for you with a bunch of cozy activities and card games. Feeling more like playing a certain kart racer, but dont want to go through the hazzle of paying for another game? Try Nemo Kart (its also in this game)!

Other note worthy stuff:
- Game requires a consistent internet connection, there is no offline mode (yet).
- You can invite a friend along without them having to pay for the game.
- Cosmetics in the game are 99.9% obtainable with in game currencies or through events, exceptions are certain collab skins. 
- All the event passes (battle passes) have been completely free up til now.
- The game updates consistantly.
- There is no penguin animal skin (pls Recreate i beg).",True,english,76561198111818170,61.766666666666666,2024-09-24 23:37:49

7/10 if I wanna be critical

I'd say this game is great if you just focus on the main parts of the game and just enjoy your time with what you have.
However, if you want to play stuff that isn't included stock... well, your wallet definitely won't be thanking you any time soon.

The music is pretty good, I'd say for every, ""Meh, it's okay,"" you'll have two, ""Dang, that's pretty good."" But to get that ""WOW"" feeling, you better cough up some of your precious dollars. This is because the songs that come with the game seem almost specifically designed to be a level or two below the paid content; not enough to really upset you, but just enough to sort of bug you. This will inevitably lead to you buying at least one of the DLC that you simply don't need. All of that knocks off a good chunk of the out-of-ten score.

If you're okay with spending money on what is, admittedly, a decent variety of songs (even if it's an objectively bad deal), then you'll have a really good experience. It's not just the songs that are better; the mapping is, too. The maps in the base-game are alright, but most of them lack a certain level of enjoyment. The DLC maps fix that, in my opinion, bringing the count of really good or enjoyable maps from 1 in 5 to 1 in 3 (or even 1 in 2). The DLC is definitely high quality from what I've seen.

But don't fret over that high price-tag as I once did. There are plenty of sales throughout each year to really enable your addiction to spending, with packs plummeting from around $30 (CAD) to just $7; sometimes, the prices can get even lower than that, so keep an eye out.

Hope this review helped someone. Thanks for reading :)",True,english,76561198944414059,13.733333333333333,2024-09-15 17:20:18

It would be great if there was a way to set the difficulty for songs played by selecting random in Freestyle.

Also, being able to queue songs after each other in Freestyle would be very nice, or maybe even a continuous mode similar to AIR but for Freestyle (i.e which keeps your scores properly).

The combat isn't excessively difficult, and the boss fights feel rewarding. 
That being said it has some major problems. Magic and Summoning are nearly useless as combat classes, with them being pointlessly difficult to level and the weapons being not as good as their range and melee counterparts. I initially started the game trying to play as a mage, but had to switch to range because mana regeneration never was decent enough during boss fights. In fact during most of the game the only decent combat class is range, with melee only being good late game with the stormbringer since early game melee is suicidal almost. Making the game play feel restricting. 
The other non combat skills are fine, I think how they are leveled should be re balanced since I think having to craft 10,000 stone bridges was kinda boring and lame. Instead I think more XP in general should be given when you kill a higher ranked enemy, fish a higher ranked fish, or craft a higher ranked item, making it so that players are not forced to grind easy things since they give just as much XP as higher ranked things. If these skills worked like that then, my point still stands since there was not a noticeable enough of a difference to make me want to consider changing tactics. 
My other gripe can be forgiven since its the 1.0 release is the the lack of vanity items, there exists like 5 sets and a few hats, mostly locked behind seasonal events, but that's it, I think for a game with so much personality there should be more options available for the player. 
Overall, fun initial experience but gets kinda worthlessly grindy for late game when played normally.",True,english,76561198329316300,114.71666666666667,2024-09-25 00:28:46

Well, Core Keeper (CK) basically fills that role, which I absolutely love. Tons of bosses, huge procedural world map, and lots of different gear and progression, with extensive crafting and house building features. The game even pays tribute to Terraria with certain easter eggs (such as King Slime). I'm actually surprised by how good (and fun) CK actually is, compared to what I expected from ""just another indie title"".

By comparison, Stardew Valley has a similar Zelda-like art style, but is far more focused around farming, social simulation, and timed events. CK has farming as well, but it generally goes more in the vein of Terraria's more combat-heavy gameplay, which I personally prefer. As for the combat, CK feels very smooth, tactile and responsive (something I felt Starbound lacked, to name another similar game).

Another side feature that I like is the ability to find special ore-heavy boulders that you can mine out with basic automation features (conveyor belts and mining drills), even though this game isn't primarily about factory automation. Think of it more as a kind of ""redstone system"" that supports the rest of the game - simple, yet useful. You will, however, be spending most of your early- to mid game digging manually through rocks, which itself isn't too bad but can feel grindy at times. I personally had issues finding Tin Ore reliably but, other than that, my first 15 hours haven't been too annoying or boring. (Besides, just today I found 2 Tin Ore boulders close to each other that are now spewing loads of tin in my general direction in ways that only Prince would sing about.)

*Stardew + *Terraria = Core Keeper.  


*-Stardew- 

Well no Dating system or Town but what is there is the Farming/Fishing/Building thingies even with a skill tree.  

Customize your own dungeon or cave dweller housing. 


*-Terraria-

Its not a sidescroller more of a flat 2D like an action rpg, sorta like zelda or havestmoon. 

Mining galore and Exploration is too be had. Boss fights and crafting weapons and armor yes all the Terraria bips and bobs is there.

Best 15$ I have spent on a game in YEARS. If I knew how good it was back then, I would have payed 100 for it. 

So I have finally beat this game. After nearly 100 hours of game play. Some of which was spent in a friends world, but most of it was just mine. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this game. The farming, the crafting, mining, fishing, the different combat styles, everything. The music and art is top tier. Every zone is a breath of fresh air when it comes to music and design, and it brought the atmosphere of each zone together in a way that not many games are able to pull off. 

I absolutely loved all of the boss fights. I did end up having a fairly cheesy build that made a lot of them a lot more trivial than they should have been, but because of this I am genuinely looking forward to playing through again, but with a much less cheesy build. I honestly had no idea what the final boss was, and literally finished it 5 mins prior to this review. 

I would like the genuinely thank the minds behind this game, the people who brought it to life in such a beautifully crafted way, because I believe this is easily a top 10 game I have played in my 25ish years of playing games. So thank you very very much Pugstorm. This is a solid 100/10 for me, and I genuinely hope that more people get to experience the simplistic bliss that is this game.",True,english,76561198066995084,98.08333333333333,2024-09-24 07:53:51

I am so glad that I did. It has been a long time since I have found a game that has pulled me in like this one has. The game play loop of exploration, looting, base building, and all the other systems and mechanics is quite satisfying. I love the fact that there is no hand holding and no pressure to accomplish objectives other than the allure to explore and experiment. 

At present I have been enjoying hopping worlds with my main character and setting up resource harvesting for my main world. I have just discovered automation and the order that can bring. I have since bought a copy for each of my children and we are all playing on a dedicated server I am hosting in my home. It has become one of our favorite pass times now.

The only gripe I have, and it is minor, is inventory management. I think like many this can be done better. Primarily a way of dealing with seeds and decorative plants. It would also be nice to have a larger radius for pulling resources from chests when crafting.

Unlike one and two that had stronger story narratives and the building was more secondary: four has the same problem (or advantage depending on your preferred style of gameplay) as three in that the story narrative is hardly there although in four it is more apparent. 
They really made this version for players that enjoy treating it like a sandbox with some minor challenges. A lot of the challenges are very simple unless you're very much not used to that gameplay or just want to create as much chaos as possible. I would say this is much more like playing dollhouse but for adults (as someone who enjoyed playing dollhouse as a kid this is much more of a pro for me). Building, decorating, and creating narratives for your Sims is pretty much the gameplay.
The base game does enough if you want to scratch that itch for a little while, but if you love it and want to play often as a comfort game then you want to invest in some of the DLC. The DLC is the real money makers for the developers and some packs are great, some mid, and a few pretty terrible. Most aren't worth the initial price so wait for a seasonal sale. They usually have a couple sales throughout the year. If you're not sure about the pack then go on Youtube! Sims has a very large and dedicated fanbase! I do recommend lilsimsie since I find her reviews to be less biased and the community is more positive. I have yet to install mods in this version since I find most of the packs I've installed to be enough for me, but I would check out the mods for fun stuff for free. Altogether it can be a really fun game, but it is kind of niche. Also checkout the gallery for fun builds! Whenever I want inspiration then I checkout the community gallery and YT for help.

The game's main strengths are its characters, story, writing, and music, which create something greater than the sum of its parts. I highly recommend this game to people looking to see the best of the visual novel genre, games that emulate legal/detective TV drama shows, people just curious what the franchise is about, and people who enjoy story rich games and logic puzzles.

My only complaint is that it takes a long time to play through these games, with each episode taking up a day easily. For a 100% playthrough, it took me just under 100 hours. This might play better on a mobile device, like a Steam Deck or other platforms, where you pick up and play in bites than sitting at a computer the whole time, but that was not my experience. At the very least, you owe it to yourself to at least play the first game in the series, Ace Attorney, which has the best story, pacing, and writing of the 3, in my opinion.

I do recommend this game, however I think the DS version still stands taller than this great game.

There were just some things that gave much more charm to the game on that platform, for example:
- The fingerprint mini-game has you tapping powder on the bottom screen with the stylus, and blowing into the mic to clear it
- Separating the interaction buttons on the lower screen, with the upper screen used completely for characters and dialog
