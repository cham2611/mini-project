HOWEVER, the biggest concern is the servers they have. Right now there's only realistically 4-5 servers running and I hear EU servers arent always up and if you're like me who lives in Australia which needs a Oceania server which doesnt exist then you're looking about 250 ping to play which lags liike crazy on Asia & US server.
Will change to a thumbs up once they've added new servers in hopefully this game continues to grow as I have high hopes for it!

UPDATE: Pretty disappointed at how the management is with this game as they try to do a lot of banning and not to mention banning stream snipers instead of focusing more time on actually trying to open new servers up so to get more exposure for the game.....Right now it's kind of a turn off so decided to uninstall it.

UPDATE 2: The good news is that other servers are up but unfortunately it's leaving players wants to support that are in the Oceania region super dead clearly the devs should be more transparent about this so now they just seem to avoid the question all together........",False,english,76561198107322630,3.6333333333333333,2020-10-26 04:30:10

Pros:
-Fantastic lore/world building
-Fantastic gameplay
-Huge world with things to do
-Great graphics/art direction
-Phenomenal soundtrack 
-Easy to get into for casual gamers, with plentiful options to make the game significantly easier

Cons:
-PC stuttering caused by shader compilation
-Certain bosses reward good RNG for a run instead of only outplaying them, however every boss is beatable with pure skill alone even if the boss uses their hardest/cheesiest moves. For example beating Malenia felt more like getting a good run than out-skilling her,
-World is vast but does not reward exploration for your specific build (i.e. there's no point in exploring if you already have a build in mind with specific talismans, etc.). Basically if there's nothing you need in a certain area then there's no point going there except for leveling purposes.
-Final boss of the main game is one of the worst main bosses

My Build:
-Melee only strength/stagger build with a two-handed colossal great sword, lion's claw, talismans that boost this playstyle, no summons, no cheesing bosses

Not too familiar with it personally, so it was a nice breath of fresh air. 

The combat is fun and there's a lot of build variety. Sometimes the controls can feel a bit janky (feels like commands aren't queued up properly if your character is busy in an animation so it feels like you have to spam buttons to get one command out sometimes).

The story was relatively interesting. The end chapter animations were a huge highlight and a wonderful little decompression moment after the (usually) intense chapter end bosses.

Areas looked very beautiful but I definitely felt like level design itself was a bit lacking (even if the environments were gorgeous). Some areas dragged on for far too long and were kind of samey (chapter 5 really felt like it would never end). 

Overall, I definitely enjoyed the game and felt like the time I spent with it was worth it. I'm looking forward to the DLC.

The Terry Bogart DLC has just released and the pattern is now clear: They are not trying to create a balanced eSport, but are releasing OP characters to sell DLC!

Every new DLC character release is like a recreation of the Stanford Prison Experiment.  Half the players switch to the new character and get to be wardens, and half the players stick with their main character and get to be prisoners.

Having to fight a constant loop of Terry, Bison, and Akuma is not fun any more.   The only successful DLC characters were Ed and Aki.  They were different enough to attract some attention, but not so overpowered that everyone switched to them.  The pattern with Akuma, Bison, and now Terry is clear.

The netcode has been pretty good to me so far, and the battle hub is hilarious to behold.

Pros
-feels like a older game in the gameplay sense, feels like the original gears of war games or halo
-After 100 hours im still looking foward to playing more
-Day 1 gave us a road map detailing the next year of content new maps for pve and pvp, new modes for pvp and pve, new enemies in pve, new weapons and more
-PvP is incredibly fun and isnt a grind fest to jump into the fun, hop in do some pvp, go back to pve no problem
- Gameplay as a whole is the best part of the game, its never been more fun to hop in and kill some heretics or some nids with a fury that would make the God Emperor of Mankind proud
-perk system is not overly complicated
-HIGH SKILL CEILING on higher difficulties when it comes to keeping your health afloat so long as your not using a melta weapon in which case the game is easy mode

cons

-issues with servers right now
-weapon balance needs to be fixed (bolt weapons need a fix for pve)
-certain enemies on ruthless difficulty feel way too meat spongy
-some extremis enemies will sometimes never die regardless of damage dealt sometimes which can kill runs on higher difficulties
-need more maps but they are otw",True,english,76561198141728573,99.5,2024-09-25 05:13:29

Some annoying things i will say about Space marine 2 compared to 1 is just lack of heal options outside of 2 stim LIMIT YOU RARELY FIND WHEN YOU NEED IT, as they ""changed"" away health regeneration off of iconic ""execution"" and only apply it to your ""Armor"" (totally not shield mechanic) but the armor recharge gauge requires you to be not in combat or danger for FIFTEENTH WHOLE SECONDS.

I am a huge fan of the 2018 GoW, and this game actually improves on it in nearly every way. I wish that I could be writing a positive review right now, because this game absolutely deserves it... on console.

I bought the steam port the second it came out, and ever since, it has been fundamentally broken. I have no idea why most other reviewers aren't commenting on this, but this port is unplayable as it stands. I can repeatedly cause it to crash to desktop simply by looking at the in-game menus. If you want to read the in game lore, the game will crash the second you select any other item than the one it initially opened on, eg. Kvasir's Poems. The game also crashes during certain fights seemingly at random. And all of this will occur after closing the game and reopening to play later from your last save, which is a very normal thing to do.

I am running the game on an asus zephyrus laptop, with a 3080 gpu, as well as 8gb of vram. I am well within the bounds of recommended specs, and run intensive games all the time with no problems whatsoever. I have tried almost every combination of settings, both in and out of the game, but to no avail. I have scoured what little there is online, and amazingly, turning it off and on again doesn't fix an in-game bug, or bugs.

I have to imagine that all the good reviews are from people who haven't picked up this game since the first time opening it, or who have only played it on console. When this bug, or bugs, is fixed, I will immediately come back and edit this review to be glowing. But in the meantime, I encourage everyone to stay far away until it is fixed, and play the console version instead.",False,english,76561198182899495,12.533333333333333,2024-09-25 04:44:06

I have gotten to the mission with Atreus and [spoiler]Angrboda[/spoiler] and I have to take a break from this game as this mission in particular is a pungent combination of every aspect that makes this game so awful...

[*] The game features an Incredibly drawn out level design that forcefully diverts attention from the main objective without creating any sort of interest in whatever else that's going on. 
[*] The dialogue/voice acting takes away from the immersion of the mission and rarely adds anything of substance to the world (Sindri, Brock, and a few others are exceptions to this). 
[*] The combat system feels inconsistent and fights including bosses feel less ""cool"" then in the other games. 
[*] The puzzles/path discovery needed to advance within missions feels redundant, unoriginal, and often times unnecessary. 
[*] And IMO the armor/weapon upgrade UI feels unrefined and outdated. 

These issues are dramatically present in the mission mentioned above but are featured throughout the ~9 hours of gameplay I've experienced so far.

On the plus side the graphics and cut scenes look amazing, and the main story so far is awesome, in spite of how hard the developers tried to destroy the interesting aspects of the story through an incredibly poorly thought out gameplay experience. 

IMO this game is nowhere near worth the $60 price tag and I heavily regret spending that amount on this game. I would seriously wait for it to go on sale somewhere below the $30 mark. 

I will most likely end up completing the main story, just for nostalgias sake, and immediately uninstall it.",False,english,76561198106538476,8.566666666666666,2024-09-24 21:49:59

The gameplay is great, I have already gotten a few hours in and I have really enjoyed the gameplay loop and what it brings to the genre, in a lot of ways it reminds me of Victoria 3, for the better and the worse. Victoria 3 is my favorite paradox game and it introduces the skeleton of an amazing game, but it had pretty rough UI navigability and was a bit bare bones on some features. After a year of updates all those problems got fixed and now Vicky 3 is fantastic. The devs are very active on the discord and are well aware of the UI issues in this game, as well as the features that need work, and they are funded for the entire first year to provide free updates to fix both.

The crafting is quite extensive and you can tell they put a lot of love into it, and it's particularly satisfying to see your civilization grow and develop, as opposed to say the Civ series which while fun in its own right, doesn't really demonstrate that besides the occasional house popping up here and there along with the buildings changing depending on the technological age you're in.

The diplomacy is very basic, and definitely leaves a lot to be desired, but it's not any worse than Civ VI's. 

The battles aren't Total-War complex, but the formations feature allowing you to put units into a battalion together is quite a nice touch, I was worried it was going to just be ""craft a unit and then send it out or whatever) but there is a basic aspect of tactical planning involved there, which I definitely hope to see expanded on in the future as well.

There's a a lot of attention to detail especially in making choices like if you are in the bottom (I think 4) ranking at the end of any of the acts(think of like timeline stages) your game is over or any of the AI is out, basically a built in game design that prevent civs having to far of a gap between their capabilities, which if was left in the game usually makes it not as fun of an experience. I believe civ 7 also mentioned they were doing something similar to this. That should also really help multiplayer games where people far way behind and theres no point in them continuing to stay in the game. I like the little battle scenes you can watch (optional), they're exactly what I've always wanted to see in CK3, wish they would take notes. Game feels pretty polished right out of the gate and I'm excited to continue and finish my first play through. I've seen some negative reviews saying it needs optimized. I look at it like this, if you want a new 2024 game with amazing clear detailed graphics, and a lot of moving detailed parts in the world that you can zoom way in or way out and still see most of everything doing their things, then you better have a 2024 spec pc (or close to it). I've had zero issues but I'm running a i9-9900 cpu with a 4090 gpu. I've played other games where even with my high specs the frames drop real low and has stuttering so to me this game is optimized pretty good especially on launch day. Hopefully they can make some more options to lower the settings for those with lower spec pc's though. If you like a mix of civ with humankind (just like civ 7 has some humankind features) and like someone else said anno's industries details then give it a shot. I can already see myself sinking a lot of hours into this, then when civ 7 comes out I'll get to do the same and compare :)",True,english,76561198032539149,7.15,2024-09-25 03:22:15

What is a little ridiculous is the lack of nuclear weapons... I mean come on. I guess it'll be in a DLC? I hope... if they are there, then my bad, they aren't in the tech tree.

I also hope there is a way to continue after the hard turn limit, that would probably flip me to not recommend as that's an artificial barrier that is inexcusable in a modern 4x game. Humankind learnt that.

It's heavy on production chains (only other 4x I know of that does this is Millennia) and heavy on producing good to make other things.  It's really like a mix of a 4x and Anno, with 4x level of city building and the detailed production chains and goods production of Anno.  Combat looks to be fairly simple but you can stack units.  You can get bonuses by creating formations as well but the battles play out in an in-the-game-world combat animation.  It's not a seperate combat window like Millennia but is in the game world itself if you want to watch it (which is totally optional) and they look really nice.  Nothing like Millennia's ugly combat window.
I haven't played more than 3 hours so far but there's seems to be a lot of depth to the game.  It's quite detailed in it's gameplay and graphically.  People go about their business in the cities you build and even have fun little animations when hovered over or clicked on.  But boy does it give your graphics card a workout.  I'm running a 4070 Super and on ultra settings with no limits on framerate it pegs the card.  Dropping it to a hard 60FPS sorted that out though.  CPU and memory are not heavily hit, just GPU.

If there's one genre I've spent most of my time in, it's the 4x genre. I've got thousands of hours in civ and stellaris. I was a bit unsure of whether or not to pick up ara based on early videos I saw online, I thought the micromanagement would get to me and it kind of does. I think the game has got that kind of special secret sauce that keeps me coming back and wanting to keep playing while avoiding some of the pitfalls of others in the genre (cough cough humankind) and introducing something fresh.

Firstly, just to get this out of the way, I've got a beastly PC running it on max settings and I never had any performance issues so I can't speak much to that. This review will be solely on the gameplay and what I like and dislike about it.

Like:
-The realistic feel of city expansion and district manipulation. Civ always felt too abstract and board-game like especially civ 6. This game introduces a level of depth that's very pleasing to toy around with.
-The details of buildings, cities, with little people and units walking around and being able to zoom very far in to see a living world that makes you feel like youre actually playing through history.  It's a step civ has never taken and I always wished they would.
-The core gameplay loop of analyzing production chains, making choices to suit your city's needs, optimizing, crafting, etc. It scratches an itch the city builder and anno enjoyer side of me finds very pleasing. Toying with these systems to get a desired outcome is very satisfying to do.

Neutrals
-Leader variety is nice, giving us 36 options from the beginning is a lot more variety than I expected. But a lot of them just feel weird. First playthrough is Copernicus of poland, which is cool, I guess, but also kind of... odd?
-The act-end cullings, this is... idk. I praised the game for its commitment to actually feeling like playing through history before but this mechanic really goes straight against that. empires randomly falling at the end of each act with the others able to scoop up their land? Kinda cool, could take it or leave it.
-Diplomacy, AI, Religion, etc. None of these systems are particularly fleshed out but I would encourage people to remember the ""base"" versions of games like Civ and Stellaris when they were first released without any DLC and how barebones those felt compared to how you can play them today. I think ara delivers a sufficient amount of content for several playthroughs.

Bad:
-The UI is just not very useful. It takes an ungodly amount of clicks to do something as simple as giving a farm a plow or heavy plow.
-Resource & Crafting management: I really enjoy the resource management this game gives and the ability one has to tweak productions, but especially in the late game it becomes a very tiring aspect as you have to navigate the sheer volume of stuff your empire produces. The game is in desperate need of some kind of automation or settings changes to make this more friendly on the player and not so tiresome. Like plows simply being auto doled out to farms in need. I think my biggest issue with this part of the game is just how dramatically it slows the overall pace down.

Overall, I'm probably going to keep playing Ara for a little while at least. I'm eager to see if Oxide and Microsoft enable modding and what directions they take the game in with future DLC. I think if you like 4x you'll probably enjoy playing this game.

Firstly, had to change some settings to get the visuals smooth. By default felt like edge scrolling/ moving around map was a bit choppy. Once that was fixed I started to get into it.

Huge learning curve. Really need to unlearn what you know in Civ and learn what Ara is all about. Its, got a different feel to it. I generally play peaceful in Civ, but in Ara I HAD to go to war. AI settling next to my capital? Nope thats not staying there! But I genuinely enjoyed the battles, even if they were simple to understand I think this is something that Civ 6 did wrong where battles and wars take a lot more micro management in Civ by bringing the units you need to the battle and shuffling around all the time, Ara gets you to preset your armies and give them formations and leaders and just put them up against the enemy. Less hassle

I saw someone say politics plays no part in Ara, I strongly disagree. Having an ally for the set amount of time that you do really helps. And maintaining that relationship I thought was really important, especially toward the end of the act. I had two AI declare war on me and with my ally it felt like ""teams"" trying to keep their positions on the board before the next act starts. I love the trade contracts. Playing as victoria I start with an extra trade route. Plus adding more routes those trade agreements really did me well. It makes trade valuable because I was getting a lot of good things from my ally and possibly more than she was getting from me because I had a focus in trade.

Im not sure about AI balancing though. When setting up the initial games, I tried a harder difficulty, when you mouse over the difficulties tool tip shows you some info, like ""small bonuses, or no bonuses"". I tried a much harder difficulty that said ""no bonuses"" but the AI were somehow constantly earning almost double prestige. Lowered to Prince and up to end of Act 1 I am winning mostly with 3200 prestige versus 2nd place of 3000 prestige. I might knock it up one level next game.

The length of the act felt long, possibly 5-6 hours, felt almost like a whole game and could stop here just after act one and say I was satisfied, but of course Im looking forward to playing next act now. I can see why the culling mechanic was added too. Its refreshes the game, like theres new focus, not like when you play civ and its the same all the way through.

Im not trying to crap all over Civ mind you. Civ is great, but Ara is fresh, its different

Its not for everyone. Need to be ready to learn a new game. Took me a while to get the grasp of the mechanics. Defo not as accessible or as familiar as Civ. But with some patience you certainly get your moneys worth. I suspect Im going to be putting hundreds of hours into this one

On the negative all I can say is apart from that little change I had to do with game settings to get it running smoother, which possibly there could be some optimization here just to get that camera to be much smoother, the crafting mechanic.. this one is although a really really nice addition, also completely impossible to keep track of. Sure there are notifications when something is not building, but you will find yourself building crafting goods and not paying attention to what was built all the time, and then every now and again go through every single building to see what tools can be used and where. Its slow and laborious. Shouldnt be this awkward.Maybe I missed something in the menus that could list all the buildings and show their upgrades in a nice tidy list, but the tutorial hasnt told me anything that can be used to this effect. Also city planning just gets lost, theres so much info on screen and though you have a list to the right showing the different zones and an icon showing the building in a slot, there needs to be something where that list might have a better visual aid to see whats actually in those slots rather than having to mouse over each icon, but the clutter that is the main screen when you are trying to annex a zone or place a building is almost useless. I heard of complaints of the UI, and I get it.

I suspect they will patch something here eventually, because it certainly has had a lot of love already. There is so much here and Im very happy with my purchase, just need a bit of patience to learn what it is.",True,english,76561197996176982,8.566666666666666,2024-09-25 01:35:19

The game still has Aha and oho effects whenver a new revelation comes in what buildings show up, what wares turn up and what synergies show up how I have to design and build up my regions. Crafting is okay, but if you think that Millenia was complex enough, then Ara will blow your mind (in a negative sense)

So far I have just explored my home continent and just settled and built myself up, straying from waging war. i just deleted a hostile tribe, but that was the only warfare I ever did.

Diplomacy is mostly non existant and I don't see any engagement to do diplomacy. Some events are nice and the graphics are pretty good, but somehow this ""Empire builder"" Feeling of Civ or Old World does not want to ignite in me so far. I still want to play a little bit more, but so far... I'd say the game is mostly mild so far.

My opinion is as follows:

ARA is a disorganized, slow, unnecessarily complex, chaotic, infuriating, patience-demanding MESS!

I will first give my score on a couple of factors that I took in mind and which I deem important for such a game, out of 10. Of course, the high cost of the game is something that largely affected my opinion in the analysis and score-giving of the following factors.

Graphics and UI: 7/10 (randomly detailed, randomly not - UI/icons etc hide the charm... detailed icons, huge icons, many icons... I'd go for a colored AOE IV icon version)
Performance: 4/10 (crashes; click-bugs; freezes; generally patience-demanding)
Acts/ages/eras: 2/10 (horrible era system - eras are only namely mentioned and the game is 3 acts - eras; the most significant thing is research and it feels incomplete and sketchy - no immersion at all - bad copy of CIV)
Maps: 3/10 (no real variety; I tried 4 randomly generated maps with different settings. Territories look dull and boring, the textures are detailed but there is no real variety, no real color, no real elevation and cliffs - mountains are simply impassable - Humankind maps look better, CIV VII maps more promising, too)
Leaders: 1/10 (very cartoonishly out of context, like you put Mr. Bean in a SAW movie - they 100% copied CIV VI here, no doubt)
Expansion: 8/10 (I do like the city cap, and territories)
Wars: 5/10 (nothing special, the AI is super dumb and will just attack for expansion till you literally wanna go play something else or quit gaming altogether)
Religion: 1/10 (no game-changer, it feels weird)

It's an attempt to create a complex game that combines Sid Meier's Civilization games, Anno and Humankind without any utility to actually apply that complexity efficiently. Full of performance issues and bugs, sometimes you have to click 3 and 4 and even 10 times to get something done. The materials, products and the buildings that make them are all over the map and the tiny, hyper-realistic circular icons that appear together are VERY difficult to distinguish from each other, so you end up clicking everywhere to find the building that you need, hoping, with your intuition and on your patience limits, that it's the one you had been looking for.

The difficulty settings are not clear. I am trying the easiest setting in an attempt to get familiar with the game while also being eager to reach the final era because I love future eras in these games. However, the easiest setting is weird. In one game, the AI was a potato, I suppose because the map was bigger so they didn't need to conquer me. In fact, I was 2 times stronger than the second AI. I gave the game up because I was overwhelmed by the production/building (and what not) UI chaos. Also, and I stress it - my device is pretty fast, the game has very annoying performance issues. No matter the settings I tried, ultra settings and lower settings give the exact same result in performance. It's just slow in average, with annoying bugs, like the game doesn't understand ""left click"" sometimes.

I see people comparing it to CIV games, and I did mention it, because the basis of the idea is similar to CIV, of course. Despite that, it's nothing like CIV VI for example, but not in a good way, because although the idea is refreshing, you end up having to deal with production all the time instead of actually enjoying the game. It's like Old World, but more complex and broken/chaotic.

There is no clear production line. There is no clear purpose. Everything revolves around ""prestige"", which is like oxygen for your empire-civ-town-village-cottage or whatever you managed to keep after being attacked 25 million times on ""easiest"". Am I an inexperienced player and should just suck up the wars thing? No, because it doesn't happen organically, the AI will attack you BY DEFAULT if they have no more space to expand, instead of making any attempt at trading (which is certainly not a game changer either). 

The graphics? Of course, pretty beautiful, but with ALL THE MENUS you are almost unable to see anything anyway, and you need to see the yields, the borders, the huge icons for units (that render them almost invisible as well), you end up with no actual space to see those ""beautiful"" graphics. Although mind you, I was looking at the buildings carefully and houses look very weird; some nice houses appear that follow the trends of each age, but then suddenly you see something like unfinished CONCRETE boxes with roofs all over the place, that make no sense at all - they look like slums, minus the high density (pun intended). 

To sum it up:

The game is WAY too expensive for its current quality (day of release). It's a sugarcoated early-access game and we all had to pay them the money because they obviously invested a lot in it and people had to get paid, but it's NOT A FINISHED GAME. It's an early-access game, and we have been deceived. However, I do understand the developers/beneficiaries' side, because we live in modern capitalism. I think by giving it an early-access phase, the game would have gotten way better ratings. You can't make people expect a finished game and give THIS, because when you will want to invest more on it, people will turn their backs on you. There are so many developers making new games nowadays, you can't just go and release an unfinished game for 60 euros (in my case).

Do I like the game? Yes, but it needs so much work. And start by firing whoever had the idea for this horrible UI, because the performance-killing detailed graphics aren't even visible anymore with that interface.

Feels like the devs made the foundations of a gameplay system then forgot to add the flavor. Feels like youre eating tacos without seasoning. You can see what they were going for but god is it bland.

in all seriousness. it lacks engaging gameplay loops. nothing i did actually felt like it made a difference. The maps even at their largest are shockingly small. All the leaders feel mostly the same with little distinction between them. by about 40-50ish turns in im jst hitting next turn without really thinking about anything.

the crafting system is meh, mostly adding complexity for the sake of complexity it feels like. and most of the systems present are obtuse, not well explained, and you generally have very little control over them. I dont know what gives me more religious tennants when or why. I dont know what spawns paragons at all. And i am not entirely clear on the purpose of this games verion of great works of art.

furthermore all the systems feel very isolated from eachother except maaaybe the economy. Religion felt disconected from the rest of the game. Diplomacy was so shallow so as to be meaningless. warefare was there i guess. and none of these systems had any interaction with any other systems it felt like. oh my religion has become dominant in rome? does this have any impact on diplomatic relations? trade relations? rates of hostility? as far as i could discern, no. nothing happened. in fact i couldnt even tell you what the point of spreading religion is. Maybe it gives more prestige? but if it does thats very poorly communicated and represented. Your economy is heavily reliant on a particular good? what are the societal ramifications of this? will other countries seek to somehow under mine this resource? buy more from you due to increased supply? respond at all? no. because diplomacy and economy only touch on the trade routes page that is basically just a glorified crafting hut.

lastly, victory conditions. so far as i could tell prestige is the only one, though i imagine domination is necessarily also possible by eliminating every other player you can only have the highest prestige. in doing  this, almost all strategy is stripped from the game. why bother pursuing culture or research or any particular niche when everything is just going to be converted into a flat ""win the game score"". instead, just do whatever is immediately convenient and it'll end up the same in the end tbh. its boring and its uninteresting and disengaging.

Worst of all for me though is that there are permanently missable items, such as a materia at the start of the game that you can never get again if you miss it. That's just bad design.

Combat is fine. There is an option for letting your guys auto attack so you can focus on commands but if you do that battles take soooooooo long whereas they go fast if you just mash x.

Beyond well optimized. Its easily one of my favorite games to play right now.

Aside from running well, this game has been everything I wanted it to be and then some. Compared to the vibe of original FF7, I think this does it a lot of justice. The characters and dialogue are fun, the Shinra menace is equally pronounced etc.

The combat is so smooth I don't even know where to start. But somehow they made a turn-based FF game feel completely naturally FF in an action RPG environment. It's great.

The pacing is good, the side quests are cute and rewarding. I feel like I wasn't wasting much time if any in this game. Everything just sorta flows when you figure out the map.

I can praise this game all day. I'm on the last chapter as of today - I only have a few issues:

-The humor can be out of place sometimes along with the fan service. Particularly when you hear Tifa say 'Man I really need a shower' for the 40th time after a fight it sorta makes you raise an eyebrow, genuinely. That crap is NOT why I'm here and it's sad to me that these adults designing these games find it adds anything to this kinda game.

-I get there is world building and the game GENUINELY at times feels like a re-imagined PS1 game but at times I feel like I'm running down long hallways for no real reason. Are the narrow passages you have to side-step through like...loading screens? Some places are just too big dude. 

-Collect-a-thon. As much as I like that and enjoy it in FF games, this game goes a little too far with the ground clutter. Way too many boxes to destroy. Personally I prefer ~80% of my items to be bought/earned from fights but I'd reckon 70-80% of your important items are in yellow-lit boxes and the battle rewards are mostly for gil. Is what it is. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I would probably enjoy *an hour or 2* Less destroying boxes on the ground.",True,english,76561197995229830,39.11666666666667,2024-09-22 20:25:37

No. However, for this remake, it feels right. Moving onto changes in the story. There are a lot I agree with, and it was nice to have a change. However, I also felt a lot didn't need a change.

- Combat gets interruped every five second because camera gotta zoom on enemy charging attack.
- Knockbacks are insane every time you get close they knock you back and they can lead to combos just becouse.
- Even if you manage to hit enemy they just automatically counter deal damage to you and send you away again.
- Party members are awful they do just bare minimum, they live long enough just becouse enemy mostly targets only character currenty controlled by player.(Also same useless character blows in next cinematic fifty ton boulder with lightning. That just makes me scream.)
- Dodge got no i frames it only avoids aoe and projectiles in melee vs bosses is pretty much useless.
- Attacks cannot be cancelled probably biggest turnback issue i have no idea why but we can only watch next three seconds getting hit and have no other option.
- I did it in second try and the WORST thing is i dont even know how..

Compared to its predecessors, it is much simpler and streamlined and feels much more like playing a physical board game with narrative vignettes than a 4k war strategy game.  Instead of splitting into the dichotomy of kingdom building and war strategy, RTK14 splits the difference.  There are no tactical battles.  The big map is the tactical map.  There is no build up and then strike, you are constantly at war and constantly defending yourself.  The pace is much faster than any other Koei strategy title I've messed with, at the expense of complexity.  But warning, this game is unforgivably difficult and does very little to prepare for it.

The biggest difference that is fun for me is the buff stacking concept. For example you use officer that can create a Ring formation and has ""Defense"" trait. Then bring another officer with ""Steel General"" to accompany him and make a camp. That single officer can reach 2000-2600 defense and will only take 1 damage per tick making him unbeatable even with low counter damage.

ROTK XI is more a strong individual unit with 3 officers skill combined, while in XIV you need to create a party that can buff each other and benefits from it which I think is very cool once you get familiar with the traits, skills and mechanism.",True,english,76561198296469970,140.21666666666667,2024-07-21 01:48:22

The battle mechanics are way worse. They did some weird thing where you can only give an order or series of orders during your turn that plays out in the battle phase. Sounds ok at first, but you'll soon find units sitting around and waiting after destroying an enemy unit while 4 hexes away another enemy army is beating up your ally. It's all based around the AI settings that you put forth, but the AI is too simplistic to be intuitive, or even show some semblance of intelligence.

You'll find everything is based around AI. All you do as a ruler is use excel with a poor UI. Duels? Only watching as two dudes just hit each other. Debates? What's that? Marriage/sworn brothers system, 10,000g for a slight buff in battle and loyalty.  Don't even get me started on their new event system.

There's not room for roleplay or to immerse yourself. Just play ROTK 8, 10, or 11, they are just more in depth and provide more. 

There is no desire for me to develop my generals. They provide you tons of skills to train your generals. But it's just a chore and takes so much time for no benefit. Maybe if I had some sort of attachment to my generals in any shape or form, I would. But it's all just stats.

For Christ's sake, ROTK4 had more depth in it and that was a SNES game on 16 bits. I don't know who they are trying to entertain with this game.",False,english,76561198053796791,51.36666666666667,2024-05-11 17:06:37

We're forced to wait until everyone is back at base before promoting them.

Difficulty Employing Characters Like Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Cai Yan: Despite numerous attempts, we're unable to employ characters like Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Cai Yan. We keep receiving alerts that they're unemployed, yet they continue to reject our offers.

Uninteresting Battle Duels: The battle duels lack excitement. I remember a version of ROTK where duels were engaging, with buttons to press for counters and other actions. Incorporating such features would greatly enhance the gameplay experience.

Lackluster Area/City Government Mechanics: The mechanics for managing area and city governments are dull. It simply involves assigning an officer and then repeatedly sending idle officers out for employment until orders are depleted.

Stagnant Background Music (BGM): The BGM remains unchanged from many versions ago, which contributes to a feeling of stagnation in the game's overall experience.

Game play and design is probably the strongest point. I appreciate tons of game mechanics that rarely found from other games in the same genre. The aesthetics, graphics, character designs, and map details are also superb. It can compare to Total war 3K, and I also found many points it is even better.
