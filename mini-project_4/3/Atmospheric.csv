Pros:
-Fantastic lore/world building
-Fantastic gameplay
-Huge world with things to do
-Great graphics/art direction
-Phenomenal soundtrack 
-Easy to get into for casual gamers, with plentiful options to make the game significantly easier

Cons:
-PC stuttering caused by shader compilation
-Certain bosses reward good RNG for a run instead of only outplaying them, however every boss is beatable with pure skill alone even if the boss uses their hardest/cheesiest moves. For example beating Malenia felt more like getting a good run than out-skilling her,
-World is vast but does not reward exploration for your specific build (i.e. there's no point in exploring if you already have a build in mind with specific talismans, etc.). Basically if there's nothing you need in a certain area then there's no point going there except for leveling purposes.
-Final boss of the main game is one of the worst main bosses

My Build:
-Melee only strength/stagger build with a two-handed colossal great sword, lion's claw, talismans that boost this playstyle, no summons, no cheesing bosses

Not too familiar with it personally, so it was a nice breath of fresh air. 

The combat is fun and there's a lot of build variety. Sometimes the controls can feel a bit janky (feels like commands aren't queued up properly if your character is busy in an animation so it feels like you have to spam buttons to get one command out sometimes).

The story was relatively interesting. The end chapter animations were a huge highlight and a wonderful little decompression moment after the (usually) intense chapter end bosses.

Areas looked very beautiful but I definitely felt like level design itself was a bit lacking (even if the environments were gorgeous). Some areas dragged on for far too long and were kind of samey (chapter 5 really felt like it would never end). 

Overall, I definitely enjoyed the game and felt like the time I spent with it was worth it. I'm looking forward to the DLC.

I only put about 60 hours into Frostpunk 1, but I was able to beat all of the campaign missions and DLCs on the 2nd highest difficulty. I became devoted to finally finishing them due to the immersion and difficulty. 

What 1 offered was a deeply immersive city builder where every choice you made, whether that was building something or a contextual event, could have a fairly significant impact on the entire play-through. 

Frostpunk 2 is something else entirely. There's no real connection with your ""citizens"" outside of the ""faction"" representatives. Nothing you do really seems to matter like it did in the first. Now, the overall gameplay is more similar to City Skylines than it is Frostpunk 1. Of course, some decisions you make in Frostpunk 2 have an impact, but it's far less.... impactful.... than the first. 

HOWEVER.... That doesn't mean Frostpunk 2 is a bad game. In fact, it's actually pretty damn awesome... And that's exactly why it's so insanely polarising. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone that enjoyed the first, as well as games like Cities Skylines.

This game has been one of my most anticipated games this year, as it was for many others, and 11-Bit Studios did not disappoint. While the first game was about survival and enduring through the hardships of the severe cold, Frostpunk 2 is about the comeback of civilization. It's much more large scale, which I personally love, and more difficult to manage. I've found that this is more about managing society than the cold, even though it's still a major part of the game. The Laws that you approve or decline may not align with what certain factions believe in. You may have to negotiate with them to win their favor. All while still keeping the generator alive, and exploring the vast land around you.

If you enjoyed the first game, and you are neurotypical and thus are capable of experiencing new things without throwing a tantrum, this game is great.

A group barely surviving the frost, now desires to conqueror it, tired of barely surviving.

The music building tension as the city crumbles over warring factions, you as the steward or in my case the Captain battling desperately to hold on just a bit more.

You'll see a lot of reviews on here complaining that this diverted too much from what made Frostpunk great and you'll see a lot of people saying that the changes made here go in the wrong direction. I disagree. This game is still VERY Frostpunk: the game throws you into the frostland and you must keep the generator running and supplies coming all while the people of your city bicker and complain about the direction you take the city. The political side of Frostpunk 2 is vastly expanded on; passing laws and pleasing factions are far more important this time around. It is a core fundamental aspect of this sequel to delve into the political landscape of your city and carefully pick and choose which laws are passed and which factions to support. The final chapter of the campaign was so intense I literally can't remember a time where a game like this got me to that level of engagement and immersion. 

You'll learn A LOT about how to progress more successfully with each new city you make, whether it be trying the campaign on harder difficulties or picking different maps in the Utopia mode. I've now gone through three runs each with varying levels of success: the first one being marginally successful just enough to get by, the second one being vastly successful ensuring that my city stands long after I die, and the third crumbling from existence because of my inability to rule it properly. This game's insistence on forcing you to learn is extremely engaging and it really is the key reason why I can see myself putting dozens of more hours into this. 

Exploring the frostland and building resource outposts, surviving the blizzards, and ensuring every faction has their voice heard all make for a gameplay system that constantly keeps you engaged and really never gives you a dull moment. Each new run on a new map presents new challenges and new opportunities. 

While many will be disappointed that this isn't the same as Frostpunk 1, I think the evolution made in this entry still makes it extremely engaging and I have high hopes for the future of this franchise.

Nothing really matters anymore. Death? It used to make me cringe everytime I'd hear the bell in the first game.

Also, the main plot? It kinda sucks honestly. At least the ending I got. I pledged to overpower the cold and restore a warm spot. But I didn't even get to see anything cool out of it! All the sacrifice, all the voices I suppressed. And I didn't even get to see like, plants growing or the local climate actually warming! All I did was burn extra fuel for literally nothing in return.

You can't create a ""utopia"" with one vision. Well guess what? It's STUPID. This is not a deep, enriching experience.

It is less about the micro-management of a small community, but rather takes a more macro-oriented approach. Think managing a large city vs a small village. There are some downsides to this - such as it feeling less ""survivaly"" and a less feeling of desperation, but there are positives as well. The game introduces new mechanics (managing factions for example), as well as improving on many of the already existing mechanics. Overall, the different approach to city-building is IMO really fun, mixed with the tried and true FP formula (weather, etc.) - making for a very fun experience, which is still very challenging in its own rite.

First game has a stylized, Frostpunk logo, and a visually intriguing background. 
Second game, plain font on a white background like every corporate company ever after 2011.
It might not seem it, but to me, having loved the first game, this sequel is immediately more bland than the first. So much so, that I refunded after I got to the second level. 

The city building is hex based now, and not nearly as fun, unique or as involved as the first. 

 Atmospherically, I felt nothing, compared to the first. For reference, the first game was so atmospherically rich, it got me to immediately install and play Metro Exodus again, because the vibe of the bleak apocalyptic winter was just so enthralling.
 
Storywise, I didn't play long enough to see. It might be good, but from other reviews I've seen, it ends like a wet fart.

I see a lot of comments suggesting interiors, and while that would be amazing, I think that's asking for a lot when the game just released. With all the different ways the pieces interact, I imagine getting the interiors to work just as seamlessly to be a whole new challenge. Maybe in a DLC far down the line, or even the next iteration. 

For now, some suggestions building off of what we have- more life, colors, and pieces. I love seeing the sheep, birds, and ducks do their own thing, but I think the game could really benefit from adding more little creatures; like horses, dogs, cats, etc. Maybe make some of them ploppable pieces. I would also LOVE to see people walking the pathways, going through doors, and passing by windows. I love to chill and admire a build after I'm finished but it always seems so empty. Maybe add a scale to adjust the frequency of people & animals for people who prefer the clearness, and for different types of builds. 
More colors of course for more creative freedom. I understand this game has a specific theme but I don't think being able to freely choose a color from a color-wheel or something similar would harm that. 
Definitely more pieces. I love how how much you can do with such simple pieces, but why not add more window shapes, doors, and lights. I believe this would only enhance the experience (especially more kinds of lights). Another thing I'd suggest would be to add a way for there to be decorations and clutter on rooftops/open spaces. For example, a patio/porch/bridge would currently only spawn these items near doors and windows on the edges, leaving the space in the middle to look empty and barren. Maybe a few ploppable decorations that could spawn other items nearby could work for these gaps. 

This game is excellent and again, it delivers. It does an amazing job working off of simplicity, and the several ways such few pieces interact. These are just a few suggestions that have come to mind when playing the game. I'm excited to spend more time relaxing in the Tiny Glade world, and I'm looking forward to see where development goes from here.",True,english,76561198209061012,3.95,2024-09-25 03:12:37

The most important part of any game to me is the story, followed by the combat mechanics, then the graphics.

1. For some reason, when the chase starts and you get hit by a car and continue driving, we did not continue. Our car got pushed to the gate and didn't move. I had to restart.
2. Then when you start fighting scavs, it's needlessly hard. It's my 2nd playthrough, on hard difficulty. On hard, I killed Adam Smasher on 2nd try at just lvl 35 with sucky cyberware, and I'd say Adam Smasher is one of the hardest bosses in the game. This thing took me 5 tries. My advice -- when you get out of car, you get blades. Forget the blades, get back to pistol, find cover and be very careful as they'll shred you very quickly. Be careful with skulls and netrunners. First time I got killed by a runner.
3. After finally doing this, I go to the ""wounded scav"" and... nothing happens. It's bugged again. Trust me, I tried everything and I don't think I did anything unusual to cause it. 

At this point I just lost it. Come on, The DLC had been out for a year now, and the base game is 4 years old at this point. I understand that making games of this scale is hard.

I am a huge fan of the 2018 GoW, and this game actually improves on it in nearly every way. I wish that I could be writing a positive review right now, because this game absolutely deserves it... on console.

I bought the steam port the second it came out, and ever since, it has been fundamentally broken. I have no idea why most other reviewers aren't commenting on this, but this port is unplayable as it stands. I can repeatedly cause it to crash to desktop simply by looking at the in-game menus. If you want to read the in game lore, the game will crash the second you select any other item than the one it initially opened on, eg. Kvasir's Poems. The game also crashes during certain fights seemingly at random. And all of this will occur after closing the game and reopening to play later from your last save, which is a very normal thing to do.

I am running the game on an asus zephyrus laptop, with a 3080 gpu, as well as 8gb of vram. I am well within the bounds of recommended specs, and run intensive games all the time with no problems whatsoever. I have tried almost every combination of settings, both in and out of the game, but to no avail. I have scoured what little there is online, and amazingly, turning it off and on again doesn't fix an in-game bug, or bugs.

I have to imagine that all the good reviews are from people who haven't picked up this game since the first time opening it, or who have only played it on console. When this bug, or bugs, is fixed, I will immediately come back and edit this review to be glowing. But in the meantime, I encourage everyone to stay far away until it is fixed, and play the console version instead.",False,english,76561198182899495,12.533333333333333,2024-09-25 04:44:06

I have gotten to the mission with Atreus and [spoiler]Angrboda[/spoiler] and I have to take a break from this game as this mission in particular is a pungent combination of every aspect that makes this game so awful...

[*] The game features an Incredibly drawn out level design that forcefully diverts attention from the main objective without creating any sort of interest in whatever else that's going on. 
[*] The dialogue/voice acting takes away from the immersion of the mission and rarely adds anything of substance to the world (Sindri, Brock, and a few others are exceptions to this). 
[*] The combat system feels inconsistent and fights including bosses feel less ""cool"" then in the other games. 
[*] The puzzles/path discovery needed to advance within missions feels redundant, unoriginal, and often times unnecessary. 
[*] And IMO the armor/weapon upgrade UI feels unrefined and outdated. 

These issues are dramatically present in the mission mentioned above but are featured throughout the ~9 hours of gameplay I've experienced so far.

On the plus side the graphics and cut scenes look amazing, and the main story so far is awesome, in spite of how hard the developers tried to destroy the interesting aspects of the story through an incredibly poorly thought out gameplay experience. 

IMO this game is nowhere near worth the $60 price tag and I heavily regret spending that amount on this game. I would seriously wait for it to go on sale somewhere below the $30 mark. 

I will most likely end up completing the main story, just for nostalgias sake, and immediately uninstall it.",False,english,76561198106538476,8.566666666666666,2024-09-24 21:49:59

Koji-Fox, come back, we miss you and your jokes. And we don't want Poochie anymore.

I was pulled into FFXVI's world in a way that XIII and XV both failed to. I can see so much of FFXIV's influence not just in the excellent production and storytelling, but in the game's refusal to waste your time for no reason. i.e. Once you've been somewhere you can fast-travel there, *optional* side-quests along the way, rewards for just playing through, clearly marking side-quests that are special, etc.

Can't say enough about the sound, it's fantastic. Whether it's the music, sound effects, or the (English) voice acting, it's clear that it got a lot of attention.

Graphics are gorgeous. Easily one of the best looking games on PC today. Very much glad to have waited to play this title on PC.

Game play is pretty much on the same direction as XV. If you don't like action combat, well... then it's not for you. I loved FF: Stranger of Paradise, and I like FFXVI's system. While this is nowhere near as punishing, it can still offer a reasonable challenge. At the same time, it actually has difficulty settings and the ability to further reduce challenge, if desired, via special accessories you get out of the gate. Skill system is fine IMO, let's you customize the way you like to play without giving you a full-blown autistic PoE-style circuit to deal with.

Story? It's dark, depressing, but very well-told some 18 hours in at this point. Tons of lore to explore and flesh out the world for those interested. But it is not necessary to study in-game lore to enjoy the story. If you like immersing yourself in your game's world, it's there for you. Otherwise, they don't waste your time by forcing you to read it.

The people complaining that it's not a true FF game because it isn't turn-based need to get real... I'd wager some few of them were probably the same ones bagging on Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon for ""being behind the times"" and still having turn-based, menu-driven, combat systems when those titles came out ~17 years ago.

Also, it has a free demo. If you're not sure that FFXVI is your cup of tea, try the demo. Your opinion is worth way more than mine when it comes to spending your own $50. And it's damn sure worth more than xXStrifeCloudiroth420Xx's retard-tier take that it's bad because Final Fantasy peaked in 1997. (Spoiler: That guy bought the FFXVI Complete Edition anyway and somehow managed to put over 400 hours into it within the first week it was out.)",True,english,76561197970820823,18.383333333333333,2024-09-25 03:26:45

I really wished that S-E kept the original plan for FF 15 with more expansions and content it was the best road trip of the 2010's I really hope to see FF 7 Remake Rebirth for the next chapter soon. 
As far as this current game it is a must play. It does take longer than what many say unless you rush it. the video quality is excellent, voice acting is great, the battle system is good long as long as you tune your magics right for the fight. The story is very well put together in my opinion. I like the use of more everyday language that really gets the story going. earlier titles sure lacked that, it is a welcomed upgrade. To make this game shine, playing it on any console doesn't do it justice. even a PS 5 Pro, very expensive and still can't do much better.

64 GB of System Memory or more DDR4 or 5
NVIDA RTX 4080 16 GB Video if you can catch a sale on it.

Most of the trailer footage is from that part too, and there lies the problem.

What I call ""Act 2"" starting out in ""Three Reeds"" is just awful padding, you constantly spend five meters lollygagging before a cutscene or someone wants to either tell you their life story, you to tell them yours or even both, with a minute or so of combat scattered around and the game just continues like that.

You want to get to the next part of the gang's ""big plan"" but first you need to get through an hour long filler arc between actual plot continuity, you could easily cut a third of the game's runtime worth of redundant cutscenes and five to 50 meter walking sections to trigger another cutscene.",False,english,76561198143774290,16.066666666666666,2024-09-25 00:18:11

391,FINAL FANTASY XVI,"Action, RPG",https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2515020/header.jpg?t=1726590088,2024-09-17,63640.49999999999,"Final Fantasy XVI is a masterfully-created game full of action, adventure and RPG elements that coalesce to create an experience like no other.

The game is visually stunning, especially in some of the story's big moments. The graphics are certainly up-to-date and look absolutely wonderful.
In terms of combat, it's a gradually-unfolding library of abilities and options that doesn't stop pouring more and more depth out to the player, which I can safely assume doesn't stop throughout the course of the game's entire story. I haven't finished the game, being only 24 hours into it, but I can safely say that the way things are structured lets you know that you'll never be at a loss for more new powers and attacks to use. I  would say the combat in this game strays from the usual of this franchise, and the developers opted for real-time button-masher slice-and-dice type of combat instead of the turn-based JRPG combat. Some similarities I can safely make are the God of War franchise and the Devil May Cry franchise, where you have a vast array of skills you can chain together in intense, fast-paced slash-and-dash combat. As I mentioned before, the combat capabilities of both Clive and his companions increases constantly throughout the game's main story campaign, starting off somewhat limited and slower-paced, with not much potential for chaining abilities or juggling an enemy with combos. However, later during the game, many options are presented to you and you can craft your own array of powers to channel depending on what you like best.

There is a skill tree, although it is much more simplistic and very surface-level compared to other games in the genre. I find this to be a positive, as I would much rather spend my time playing the game than stuck in the menus trying to navigate a digital library of damage and armor numbers.

The story is absolutely enthralling, with a lovable cast of characters each with their own personalities and personal stories. Clive is a wonderful protagonist with an incredible voice actor and a perfectly-structured list of motivations that shifts in a very sensible and relatable way throughout the game's story. You get to see the entire tale unfold right from the beginning and even from other characters' perspectives at times.
I would draw a comparison between this and George R.R Martin's Game of Thrones, as the political aspects of the world's nations and interactions between their powerful figures, their plots and their schemes, intertwines with the fantastical nature of FFXVI's realm to create a very, very immersive story.

This is only my second Final Fantasy game, having only played FF15 before this. I can easily say that this time around, the game's story and worldbuilding is on an entirely different level of maturity. It is darker, grittier, and more brutal, and the game does a great job expressing this in its cutscenes, the carefully-designed environments, and the dialogue of the characters. There is even an NPC that comes up during the main story, which educates the protagonist on the state of the world, really delivering more information and lore to the player as part of a collection of entertaining cutscenes.

This game's boss fights are some of the most epic and memorable I've seen in any video game. There are amazing massive-scale fights that feel almost addictive, and really spark a flame of that power fantasy for the player. I can't say any more without spoilers, but if you're looking for some visually-stunning large-scale boss fights, you can't do much better than this game, save for maybe the God of War franchise or Shadow of the Colossus.

As for performance, I am running this on an i9 with a 3060ti and 32gb ram. The game runs very smoothly often times for me, with a bit of roughness on day 1 of PC release. My computer restarted a few times when playing this game, but that issue has faded away entirely. Over the course of my 24 hours of gameplay, I've experienced only 1 or 2 second-long brief patches of FPS loss, which did not happen very often. Maybe once or twice per session, during the particularly weighty moments where there was alot to see on-screen.

The only problems with this game are as follows:

I find the pacing to be rather slow between the big main story moments. It's fine and dandy to run around doing normal things every once in a while, but sometimes it drags out a tiny bit and it feels a little like a chore. Despite this, the game's story uses the time it is given by the slow pacing to further flesh out the characters. Turning the bad into good, I suppose - I like it :)

Loot - the game throws out new weapons, armor pieces and accesories at you, which have their own numbers and effects that can be pretty interesting. However, there isn't really any time during the game where you'd defeat an enemy and your jaw would drop because you got a rare piece of loot, that kind of joy isn't made available by this game, unfortunately. The weapons do change the visuals of Clive's sword, but mechanically, all they change is a number. It would've been nice to see some of the weapons or armor pieces being a little bit more involved in combat than simply changing around the number of damage you do in a hit, or how much HP you have, and such.

There is little in the way of customization. At some point in the game, you do gain the ability to change Clive and his companions' appearance, by selecting one of some outfits that are made available to you. I find this extremely limited, and I'd love the ability to change around individual pieces of Clive's armor. That's alot to ask for, so I'd settle for just a few more outfits to be made available in the game. FF15 was the same way, but that one had quite a few more options than FF16.

That's all I can say for this game. I can see myself playing it all the way through and I'm super excited for everything that comes next :)
That being said, my rating for this game is a solid 9/10. If you're a fan of hacking and slashing through enemies, navigating a fantastical world with carefully-designed environments, and being immersed in a wonderful and interpersonal story, FFXVI is the game for you",True,english,76561199095385764,24.866666666666667,2024-09-24 20:51:52

Overall Final Fantasy XVI does a lot well, and a lot much worse leading to what is unfortunately one of the most mediocre Final Fantasy games to date. Combat system is simple but fun and allows for a lot of personality in the way you can set up combos. The RPG part of Final Fantasy may as well not exist in this entry as it adds little to nothing to the overall experience.

This however is a review of the PC port specifically, which on top of the high price of entry for what is essentially a year old game now, the dreadful performance is its biggest issue and really hampers the experience. Please read on and allow me to explain the issue from my perspective.

Square Enix blames the issues on the ""hardware requirements"" which in reality is just an excuse for a badly optimised port which is not something we as consumers should be putting up with especially for a game we waited over a year for the PC release. With a recommended spec of an RTX 2080, the requirements are astronomical and to that point my PC with an RTX 3070 ti (which should outperform a 2080) can't even get anywhere near ""acceptable"" performance.

To clarify so that everyone understands the problem, I run the game at 1440p  on the lowest settings WITH super resolution (DLSS 3.) My PC has a 5900x and a 3070 ti. The game looks AWFUL. In most areas of the game, I can just about reach 60fps, in towns and combat however this often drops into the low 40s or even 30 FPS range which is UNACCEPTABLE for a port in 2024 and just proves that SE has fallen from grace when it comes to delivering a solid game on PC which is such a shame when masterpieces like Baldur's Gate exist that really show what a company that cares can do.

Wait for fixes or a sale before you buy if you have anything but the top 5% of hardware.

TL;DR: The game itself is okay-ish. If you're a fan of action games (yes specifically action, not action-RPG) then this is for you. If you have a PC that is anything but a 80/90 series card from RTX 4000 then stay away as this will not perform well.",False,english,76561198109597510,6.2,2024-09-24 20:19:13

However, there are several things that weigh the experience down. The story forcing you to load into quests solo, watch the unskippable cutscene, then have you or your friend leave their instance in order to play together is a major pain point. The lack of  proper weapon tutorials hurts on-boarding for new players, as they need to consult third party guides just to understand how their weapon functions. Menus are annoying at best and unintuitive at worst. While most of the issues I've mentioned so far are minor in the grand scheme of things, a major gripe I have with the game has to do with the unequal treatment of weapons in regard to dealing elemental damage. Having half of your arsenal be objectively inferior to just using a weapon with more raw damage hurts build diversity, and is incredibly disappointing when you want to build around a monster's weakness, only to end up doing worse because your weapon isn't good for elemental damage.

Pros:
* Amazing cutscenes
* Decent story for a Monster Hunter game
* The weapons feel good to use (at least the ones I tried)
* Most of the new monsters have great designs and fights
* The mantles are a decent new addition

Cons:
* The clutch claw is not only janky with nonsensacle physics, it is necessary to beat most late game monsters in iceborne if you're playing alone and it made my favorite weapon type (Dual blades) unusable until the post game of the DLC without making insane builds for each monster
* Cutscenes are unskippable even on a second playthrough and make playing through the game with friends a nightmare with how they're implemented
* Most of the weapon designs not only look like trash, they don't even match the respective armor well

Don't get me wrong, the game is amazing and I recommend playing it, but these issues just really bother me and I'm glad most of these seem to be fixed in MH Wilds",True,english,76561199201204193,194.93333333333334,2024-09-23 19:26:07
