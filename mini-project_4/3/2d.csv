7/10 if I wanna be critical

I'd say this game is great if you just focus on the main parts of the game and just enjoy your time with what you have.
However, if you want to play stuff that isn't included stock... well, your wallet definitely won't be thanking you any time soon.

The music is pretty good, I'd say for every, ""Meh, it's okay,"" you'll have two, ""Dang, that's pretty good."" But to get that ""WOW"" feeling, you better cough up some of your precious dollars. This is because the songs that come with the game seem almost specifically designed to be a level or two below the paid content; not enough to really upset you, but just enough to sort of bug you. This will inevitably lead to you buying at least one of the DLC that you simply don't need. All of that knocks off a good chunk of the out-of-ten score.

If you're okay with spending money on what is, admittedly, a decent variety of songs (even if it's an objectively bad deal), then you'll have a really good experience. It's not just the songs that are better; the mapping is, too. The maps in the base-game are alright, but most of them lack a certain level of enjoyment. The DLC maps fix that, in my opinion, bringing the count of really good or enjoyable maps from 1 in 5 to 1 in 3 (or even 1 in 2). The DLC is definitely high quality from what I've seen.

But don't fret over that high price-tag as I once did. There are plenty of sales throughout each year to really enable your addiction to spending, with packs plummeting from around $30 (CAD) to just $7; sometimes, the prices can get even lower than that, so keep an eye out.

Hope this review helped someone. Thanks for reading :)",True,english,76561198944414059,13.733333333333333,2024-09-15 17:20:18

It would be great if there was a way to set the difficulty for songs played by selecting random in Freestyle.

Also, being able to queue songs after each other in Freestyle would be very nice, or maybe even a continuous mode similar to AIR but for Freestyle (i.e which keeps your scores properly).

The combat isn't excessively difficult, and the boss fights feel rewarding. 
That being said it has some major problems. Magic and Summoning are nearly useless as combat classes, with them being pointlessly difficult to level and the weapons being not as good as their range and melee counterparts. I initially started the game trying to play as a mage, but had to switch to range because mana regeneration never was decent enough during boss fights. In fact during most of the game the only decent combat class is range, with melee only being good late game with the stormbringer since early game melee is suicidal almost. Making the game play feel restricting. 
The other non combat skills are fine, I think how they are leveled should be re balanced since I think having to craft 10,000 stone bridges was kinda boring and lame. Instead I think more XP in general should be given when you kill a higher ranked enemy, fish a higher ranked fish, or craft a higher ranked item, making it so that players are not forced to grind easy things since they give just as much XP as higher ranked things. If these skills worked like that then, my point still stands since there was not a noticeable enough of a difference to make me want to consider changing tactics. 
My other gripe can be forgiven since its the 1.0 release is the the lack of vanity items, there exists like 5 sets and a few hats, mostly locked behind seasonal events, but that's it, I think for a game with so much personality there should be more options available for the player.

Well, Core Keeper (CK) basically fills that role, which I absolutely love. Tons of bosses, huge procedural world map, and lots of different gear and progression, with extensive crafting and house building features. The game even pays tribute to Terraria with certain easter eggs (such as King Slime). I'm actually surprised by how good (and fun) CK actually is, compared to what I expected from ""just another indie title"".

By comparison, Stardew Valley has a similar Zelda-like art style, but is far more focused around farming, social simulation, and timed events. CK has farming as well, but it generally goes more in the vein of Terraria's more combat-heavy gameplay, which I personally prefer. As for the combat, CK feels very smooth, tactile and responsive (something I felt Starbound lacked, to name another similar game).

Another side feature that I like is the ability to find special ore-heavy boulders that you can mine out with basic automation features (conveyor belts and mining drills), even though this game isn't primarily about factory automation. Think of it more as a kind of ""redstone system"" that supports the rest of the game - simple, yet useful. You will, however, be spending most of your early- to mid game digging manually through rocks, which itself isn't too bad but can feel grindy at times. I personally had issues finding Tin Ore reliably but, other than that, my first 15 hours haven't been too annoying or boring. (Besides, just today I found 2 Tin Ore boulders close to each other that are now spewing loads of tin in my general direction in ways that only Prince would sing about.)

Best 15$ I have spent on a game in YEARS. If I knew how good it was back then, I would have payed 100 for it. 

So I have finally beat this game. After nearly 100 hours of game play. Some of which was spent in a friends world, but most of it was just mine. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this game. The farming, the crafting, mining, fishing, the different combat styles, everything. The music and art is top tier. Every zone is a breath of fresh air when it comes to music and design, and it brought the atmosphere of each zone together in a way that not many games are able to pull off. 

I absolutely loved all of the boss fights. I did end up having a fairly cheesy build that made a lot of them a lot more trivial than they should have been, but because of this I am genuinely looking forward to playing through again, but with a much less cheesy build. I honestly had no idea what the final boss was, and literally finished it 5 mins prior to this review.

I am so glad that I did. It has been a long time since I have found a game that has pulled me in like this one has. The game play loop of exploration, looting, base building, and all the other systems and mechanics is quite satisfying. I love the fact that there is no hand holding and no pressure to accomplish objectives other than the allure to explore and experiment. 

At present I have been enjoying hopping worlds with my main character and setting up resource harvesting for my main world. I have just discovered automation and the order that can bring. I have since bought a copy for each of my children and we are all playing on a dedicated server I am hosting in my home. It has become one of our favorite pass times now.

The only gripe I have, and it is minor, is inventory management. I think like many this can be done better. Primarily a way of dealing with seeds and decorative plants. It would also be nice to have a larger radius for pulling resources from chests when crafting.

I highly recommend this game to people looking to see the best of the visual novel genre, games that emulate legal/detective TV drama shows, people just curious what the franchise is about, and people who enjoy story rich games and logic puzzles.

My only complaint is that it takes a long time to play through these games, with each episode taking up a day easily. For a 100% playthrough, it took me just under 100 hours. This might play better on a mobile device, like a Steam Deck or other platforms, where you pick up and play in bites than sitting at a computer the whole time, but that was not my experience. At the very least, you owe it to yourself to at least play the first game in the series, Ace Attorney, which has the best story, pacing, and writing of the 3, in my opinion.

I do recommend this game, however I think the DS version still stands taller than this great game.

There were just some things that gave much more charm to the game on that platform, for example:
- The fingerprint mini-game has you tapping powder on the bottom screen with the stylus, and blowing into the mic to clear it
- Separating the interaction buttons on the lower screen, with the upper screen used completely for characters and dialog

These are just simply experiences that you'll never experience without the hardware of the time.

The combat is fun to me. Its a turn based game so if you don't like that then maybe but a different game.  The characters all get new abilities and weapons and spells that keep it fresh. The outfits in this game are all free to get if you can find them.

Patience. This game requires you to be patient with its storytelling. The above quote perfectly describes the game with its phenomenal storytelling and visuals. The game devs have carefully crafted the way the story is being presented. The cutscenes might make some players hesitant to continue, but just be patient and keep progressing, the end is worth it.

I myself have no problem sitting back and absorbing the story through cutscenes. The grappling chain arm and game mechanics have good momentum to enjoy the gameplay. I wish that there were some more upgrades or weapons customization but it's still fun and exciting trying to clear the levels.

Saying Sanabi is a Katana Zero clone would be a huge disservice to this game. To me, both are exceptional gems.

But before I continue to sing my praises to this game, what exactly is Sanabi?

Well, in this action platformer game, you play as a retired veteran with a simple mission, which is to hunt an entity called ""Sanabi"". To do this, you will use your chain hook prosthetic arm to get around a city called Mago. This weapon can also be used to hook yourself to the enemies, destroying them in the process.

This grappling hook mechanism means that you will spend most of your time in the air, going from one platform to another, from one enemy to another, from one boss to another. And when done right, it feels oh so good, especially because of the tight movement. Makes you feel unstoppable, and it gets the adrenaline pumping!

I said ""when done right"", because at first, I struggled getting used to the grappling hook gameplay and gamepad controls. Because not only you can hook the enemy, you can boost yourself, slow down time, jump, and so much more. But overtime, I learned to get good and finally experienced that flow state.

Surprisingly, even with this addicting gameplay formula, my favorite part of Sanabi is still the story. Without spoiling anything, you will be confused at first because of the mysteries surrounding Sanabi and Mago are pretty complicated, but once you connect the dots, it will be mind blowing. 

At least mine did, that's for sure. It makes me want to replay the whole game instantly to see all the hints I missed.

Not only mind blowing, Sanabi's story has a lot of heart thanks to its characters. Mind you, Sanabi doesn't have too many characters, since you spend most of your time with a hacker girl named Mari, who's helping you find Sanabi, and her robot companion Mufin.

While Mari might be too talkative to some, I found her character very charming, I really enjoyed her funny personality and antics, and I think the game definitely won't be the same without Mari.

I was too invested in the story of Sanabi, the retired veteran, and Mari. By the end of the game, I was left sobbing my eyes out, heck, I instantly went to write a review, three years after I wrote my previous review.

All of these positive points, combined with the epic soundtracks and the eye catching pixel art, makes the game a complete package worth checking out, even in full price. Scratch that, I insist YOU to try out this game if you love some fast paced action gameplay and heart tugging storytelling.

With that being said, to Wonder Potion a.k.a the developers, I'll be looking forward to your future games! Doesn't matter if it will start as an Early Access product again, I WILL be there!",True,english,76561198148661644,12.6,2024-09-22 14:40:24

The story, the artstyle, the game mechanics, the world-building, and the soundtrack are all top notch. It does however get really tedious at times. It's clearly heavily inspired by Katana Zero, but where Katana Zero effortlessly succeeds in integrating an intriguing plotline with its fast-paced gameplay. This one fails; miserably at times. It felt like the cutscenes and gameplay were constantly interrupting each other, the second you get into the gameplay and are being thrown challenging enemies, you're interrupted by a cutscene twice as long, and when the story gets interesting, you're interrupted with the gameplay. At some point it was hard to enjoy the game cause there was this constant anticipation that the gameplay would come to a grinding halt with a dense cutscene.
I played the speedrun after completing the campaign, and playing it felt leagues better than story mode, the gameplay felt more connected and fluid.
The story is definitely worth experiencing but I don't think it warrants the awful gameplay to cutscene ratio. A lot of it could have been condensed, some of it could have been shown in collectables or records people who are interested could go out of their way to find, having cutscenes between longer sequences of gameplay, etc.

It's good but it would've felt so much better had it put its fast-paced gameplay front and centre, and it seems they could've easily done that.",True,english,76561198303990922,17.666666666666668,2024-09-20 06:59:45

This is a very good game, but it is certainly not a game that deserves an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" tag.  Here's why:

(1) The best part of this game is the story; there is little doubt about that. Though the story is very good, it is absolutely not original, as it is basically an exact copy of a couple very specific movies. Still, the story is worth getting through. I suggest you don't read anything about it and just go through it without any spoilers of any type, even the trailers.

(2) The problem with this ""game"" is that there is too much emphasis on the story.  You will spend significantly more time watching cut scenes and reading dialogue than actually playing.  That sounds like an exaggeration, but it is 100% true. There is LESS TIME SPENT ON GAMEPLAY THAN ON CUT SCENES. 

(3) The game took some obvious inspiration from Bionic Commando.  Swinging around is fun, but that is basically all you do.  There is little combat here and it is as simplistic as you can possibly get while still calling this a game. 

(4) It way too easy. The challenge of the game is figuring out and becoming adept with the controls.  Once you do that, you fly through the game with ease. 

Some of the reviews compare this to Katana Zero, even saying that it is better than Katana Zero.  I don't think this game is playing in the same league as Katana Zero.  Katana Zero is a far superior game. 

This could have been a legitimate classic if there was more time spent on gameplay and less on cut scenes. This game is a B.  I am not suggesting that you should not play it, as it has its fun parts, but this is really more a movie than a video game.",True,english,76561198027895986,11.7,2024-09-14 16:48:15

Yes the first 3-4 chapters of the game start slow but after that there's an exploration phase and battle in every chapter. Really though I think the gameplay is where the game shines the most, it's a great challenge on hard mode and New Game+ carries over pretty much everything, one of the best in any games I've played. You don't have job reclassing like FFT but you promote units similar to older Fire Emblem games, with the 30 playable characters you get there's plenty of room to experiment. Every unit plays differently and the game encourages you to try synergies between them, no one is OP enough to solo the game by themselves or completely useless that they should be never be used. 

I will say though that the English localization is pretty meh, it's like FF Tactics War of the Lions on the PSP, added sentences that weren't present in the original and using out of place archaisms. I switched to French text and it was a lot more enjoyable, and more faithful to the Japanese script too.

I still cannot recommend buying it if you are looking for an FF Tactics style GAME. It's more or less just an interactive ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" story/political debate class simulator.

My first play through took about 25 hours, and - not exaggerating - less than half of that was actual game play; that 25 hour mark includes me getting bored and fast forwarding through most of the dialogue for the second half of the game because there is just a ridiculous amount. For comparison, my first New Game+ play through, skipping all cut scenes, took less than 10 hours.

My total played time is for 4 routes, so I will give them credit for making me OCD about checking off all of the various characters and endings. Unfortunately, that's the only draw. The ""tactical"" battles are quite shallow and only require a little bit of strategy for a couple of very specific encounters on Hard mode, and the most interesting combat decisions you'll ever make only has to do with one very specific ending, where you split up your characters into 3 teams.

the only real detriment is that the game is pretty narrative heavy, especially in the beginning. but while some people may find that to be a negative, for me and others a little slog in the beginning is worth it for what is overall an excellent plot with great characters, and an interesting philosophical conflict.  The narrative accomplishes a lot while keeping events and characters very distinct and easily recognizable.  

the music and art are best in class

the combat is excellent, with a large cast of distinct characters with interesting upgrade trees and other progression systems.  Lots of distinct combat scenarios and objectives that incentivize you using different character combinations and strategies.  3 distinct main story paths each with sub paths, as well as a hidden 4th 'true' path.

Pretty solid. Enjoyable combat. Has a lot of story, if not too much. It leans heavy on story choices & has multiple playthrough potential if you care to see all paths taken.

As a turn based strategy addict of the first water TRIANGLE is what I have been looking for since I first found  Civilisation 6.

The battles are superb to participate in, for a 71 year old man who cant manage the urgent demands of real time, as is training the troops and the off battle action - its addictive and challenging and really well crafted.

Reminds me a bit of Battle Brothers but for me TRIANGLE has a slicker and more strategic fight engine.

I love the shit out of it, and it does everything I wish fire emblem would do in terms of making battles feel more tactical.  

I understand it isn't for anyone, because the story, while VERY GOOD (Like Game of Thrones-esque) is very long to get through between battles, so the gameplay loop if you want to engage with the story is like 1 hour story, 1 hour gameplay, assuming you want to see the story (You can skip dialogue very easily and quickly if you are that kind of player, no mashing the a button here).  

But the combat is really fun!  Every character feels unique and special, with abilities from creating walls of ice to block enemy pathways to riding birds to snipe enemies from buildings they can't even get to, the game really does try to encourage you to think, and doesn't just rely on flat numbers for balancing.

I played the game through the end, but it hard to say I really enjoy playing it. For me, It like playing visual novel game with some part of battle strategy more than turn based strategy game.


It's kind of boring since this game present you with 70% story consist of more than an hour dialogue before starting 30% game play battle in each chapter. 

I dare not to say the story plot is bad. On the contrary, you will find great plot with hard time decision to make which influence further outcome and story line. And not to mention about battle gameplay, I really love it.

However, no matter how intense the story and how great the gameplay mechanics, the unbalance between dialogue and battle gameplay spoils overall experience.

I enjoyed the political human vs human story quite a bit, kinda like a GoT-lite, which I was very much in the mood for. I enjoyed all of the characters too. The game has the same character artist as OT2, Naoki Ikushima, and I love his work. I feel like he gives everyone so much personality. There's also a party voting mechanic that influences your story path, which I quite liked.

The SRPG gameplay was fun. There's an emphasis on flanking mechanics, which I found interesting. Character progression and customization is somewhat limited, which I didn't really mind. (I wasn't interested in figuring out super complicated custom character builds.) Part of the fun comes from having a huge roster, and picking the right characters for each battle. The problem with this is that the game is rather stingy with character upgrade materials, so you end up focusing on just a few characters to upgrade. There are four potential endings to the game, including one true ending that is pretty much impossible to get on a first run. I HATE it when games expect you to play NG+.

A lot of people complain about the story-focus of the game. They describe it as a visual novel with some battles scattered in between. As I said, I actually really enjoyed the story, but the pacing was terrible. For example, there was one point after a battle where I unlocked 15 non-related cutscenes at once. Painful, even with fast forwarding, particularly due to the regular standard of dialogue in Japanese games.

It requires a lot of time to get through the story and ensure you're leveled enough to get through each battle, but it's so much fun. The story was interesting enough that I was excited to see another scene after each battle and the mechanism of making your party ""vote"" and then choosing what path to take based entirely on the vote. Noting, I never once felt that I couldn't get the party to ""swing my way"" with the votes, but even still, there are some tough choices, and as some of the situations come to a head you'll wish you had a magic wand to right all the wrongs because you know the world is set up to where you can make a difference but you can't save everyone, do everything right, and that's gonna make you play it over again OR follow a guide to get the golden ending. 

I did know there was a golden ending, and I thought I should possibly follow a guide to get it, but I was having too much fun choosing my answers blindly. The only painful thing is, as an adult, it's hard to find the time to beat one game that takes 100 hours much less beating it over again, but some gems are worth it! I barely had any playtime with my favorite character (Prince Roland's sister, Cordelia), and I see from the achievements that she's a playable character? Not on my first try, she wasn't! So, of course, I'm going to play it over again. And I want to see the best ending, because now I care about the world and the characters. The story tone is more serious than I'm used to when I think of a typical jrpg, somber, and there isn't a lot of comedy, but it works well for the setting. 

Yes, I did have some flashbacks to FF tactics, and I think even some of the sprites are from the same pack of 'NPC soldier characters.' hah! I could barely get the name of the game out to my friends ""triangle strategy"" sounds like a nerdy math game! Eww, what's this a game about Pythagorean theorem?!

Towards the end, each time you finish a battle at the required level, you'll see the next battle requires you be several levels higher, which entails more 'practice fights' in your camp to level up. That did get annoying as the story started heating up towards the end - you want to see what happened, not spend 2 hours leveling everyone up! But that's a testament to good storytelling.

The most common complaint right off is that there is a lot of story. There is, but the thing that isn't mentioned is that the story is quite good. There are many decision points along the way that present true moral conundrums to balance between what the characters need and what is right. 

The tactical game is interesting and balanced through NG. I have not gone farther than two play throughs so can't comment on other runs, but so far the scaling does not take anything away nor does it feel like just bigger numbers. 

Every character feels viable in some way, some are easier to determine their use and feel more powerful right off but with a little bit of experimenting everyone has a strong case to be in the party. Some characters may feel more useful over time as they are leveled up or playing at higher levels as well. At all times it was difficult to not want to take everybody but for some levels with the terrain and start positions some characters really would shine. 

I am a big fan of tactics game but I do lean hard into needing a good story to make each battle feel good. This game his great theme music for each character and specific places, acceptable voice acting, and just looks great and plays great. 

I wouldn't let the length of story cut scenes scare you off, if you enjoy any kind of political maneuvering in your story it's a great one that'll will add a lot of context to the battles you are fighting while also getting to play around with some great combat that has a strong emphasis on positioning.

Gameplay it didn't really hook me and i don't like how the leveling goes, sometimes we need to prolong the battle so we get more exp by using skill/attacking which makes the battle and farming way longer. I also dislike that they need to add 2 higher level for every battle since it's getting annoying that sometimes the gap between each battle is short which makes me goes to grinding for level after 5 minutes ago i did it. 
I start to play on normal and find the level gap was pretty punishing which makes leveling more mandatory and changing it to easy/very easy help with that my unit didn't get deleted after a couple hits.

Story wise, the story start pretty slow but after that the story get really interesting and i love how the story keep giving me no good choices which makes me personally really invested one every voting. The conflict between each character is also good and pretty realistic with their situation and background, although the side character are not really interesting but at least they add more option of play style.

I finish with Benedict Ending and i like the amount of emotion of each character involved on the end which i wish it happen more often not only in near the end, also Benedict is the goat. I honestly curios to see the other route and ending but i'm not really replaying most game i play to begin with and the game play loop really not motivate me to grind more either. The other complaint i have would be the background, the background is really pretty and the sole reason i interested playing (i play Octopath traveler before which makes me fall in love with the art style) but i don't like that they only have a chunk of area and the rest is just a flat background map which annoyed me. I was hoping to see a beautiful places like Octopath.

Id assume i had maybe 2 or 3 more missions to go. couldnt have been far off from the end anyway. But i just couldnt finish the game because for me too many of its late game missions are far too ""puzzley"" for my taste. Where youre kind of forced into doing battles in a very specific way in order to not lose. And im not a fan of having to save scum in games in general or having to otherwise reload saves multiple times over as well as replaying missions a million times until i finally get it right.

For example the last mission i was one was a stealth mission. And if i didnt get to a certain point with all my units on the map with out alerting the guards and hold it (which felt impossible to do. i couldnt figure out how to not eventually alert the guards) a bunch of enemy units spawn in random places and it becomes nearly impossible to win at that point because just about every unit is elite. 

I will 100% still give this game a recommend though to anyone who likes turn based tactics rpg's like fire emblem or final fantasy tactics from back in the day or other games along those lines. The story is pretty solid and enjoyable in my opinion. Albeit kind of predictable in a lot of areas as it kind of plays out like a game of thrones kind of story. Still has some suprises though here and there even with that being said. 

The combat is slightly janky if youre using a mouse and keyboard so if you have a controller id recommend that over m+kb but it does still work if you do use mouse and keyboard. 

Its too bad it didnt hold my attention all the way through because i was really enjoying the game for the first 15 or 20 hours or so but just those puzzley missions that make you save scum and re load saves over and over and over until you finally get it right really loses my attention. And if you also dont like that in games then id say tactics ogre reborn is the better way to go over this game and its roughly the same price.

But if my few gripes dont bother you at all then id 100% recommend this game if you are already a fan of turn based tactics games or even if youre new to this genre this would be a great start. 

Also, i guess i should warn people that if you dont like stories in games and would rather skip every piece of dialogue, dont buy this game. Because you have to pay attention to the story in this game for a certain game mechanic and the first 8 hours or so is far more story focused than battle focused so if you just blast past dialogue in games id say this one isnt for you.",True,english,76561198161716524,38.2,2024-06-17 19:53:30

From the very little I got to experience the battles seem interesting enough and I like the graphics, but its just not worth it to listen to endless - very badly written and voice acted - dialogue. Yes, I know you can skip all of it - but considering how much of it there is - I'm pretty sure its kind of the point.

If you like visual novels go ahead, but for me its a hard pass. This was one of the very few games in my backlog that I actually was looking forward to playing. Shame.",False,english,76561197960818345,2.05,2024-06-13 21:50:39
