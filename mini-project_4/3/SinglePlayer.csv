I'm a person who should love this game. HOWEVER: DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP. Paradox are scum merchant wanna-be pimps who don't care about making a game good or even coming close to CK2.

DO NOT SUPPORT A NOW TERRIBLE GAME COMPANY WHO ESSENTIALLY TELLS THEIR PLAYERS THIS:

""I want you to pay more for less. I don't want to make a good game. I won't add all the content from CK2 into the game unless you pay me to do the exact same work again, even though I already did all of that work and I am saving and holding back key gameplay mechancis to strategically milk you, the stupid player. I want all your money, and you are a stupid for buying the game, but that's your problem not mine. I wish I didn't have to develop games at all. I have no passion for strategy games, I do, however, like the sound of coins jingling as they come out of your pocket. Have a $15 DLC that changes nothing and is worse than the previous game (the black death one).. you will pay for it because you are stupid. Remember how good CK 2 was? Give me your money and I MIGHT, EVENTUALLY make the game like that...  I don't really care to make a good game or one that is even half of the previous one, but give me the money anyway. It's 3d people, that means you should pay me money. The new graphics are worth something right? Hmmm... I might be on to something here.... How about $15 for a few new models of a flag and a cup which give some flat bonuses (a couple of modders could do this work very easily and would have come up with something far more interesting. With a full team I can't believe that this took more than two-three weeks to actually make [if that even! We are talking flags, cups, and stilted idle animations that barely move at all!)... Did I mention I want your money and I don't want to work at making a game? My day is filled with drinking beer and doing nothing because you give me money to do that. Once my beer money starts running out I might code a half-baked mechanic while i'm hungover... I want your money, and I want to do as little as possible to get that money... give me the money. I want to make very, very, very small changes over time so that I don't have to work hard, then 5 years from now (that would be 9 years since release) the game will be like CK2 and you will have to buy all the DLC!!! MONEY, I LOVE THE MONEY, AND I DON'T LIKE TO WORK FOR IT! I don't want to make a good game, I want to make a game that makes you give me money. I hate my player base and I don't care if my game is worse than the previous version. No, I won't fix it for free, give me money. Buy this game instead of the old one because I will make more money. Did I mention the mechanics are half as deep and some are broken... who cares, give me the money. I added boobs into the game guys, real boobs, nips and all! That's worth some money right. Forget that you could mod that in if you wanted to in CK2 (plus who the hell cares anyway! If you want the pr0n0xxx just watch that for free guys), forget about CK2 and it's fully developed mechanics where each culture plays a lot different. That's actually bad game design because I want your money. If I give you a bad game now, and make you pay money to get even to half of what CK2 was that's good for me! Again, I want your money, I don't want to deliver a good product, but I still want your money. Here, take a DLC that is a broken version of IDENTICAL CONTENT FROM CK2... It's better because it is CK 3 instead of 2. Three is bigger than two, right? MONEY. I LOVE MONEY! I LOVE MONEY! I hate work. Excuse me while I go back to thinking about how I can do as little as possible while still getting you to pay for it, but, in reality I'm just going to go count your money instead... even thinking about the game is too much work. Stop expecting a good game guys, geez, game development is soooo hard... maybe a bit more money would motivate me to make an actual game for you.""

This game is worse than CK2 in almost every single way. There is nothing new here. Even with new DLC added it is HALF THE GAME THAT CK2 was. 

I ask you: WHAT IS THE POINT OF BUYING THIS GAME WHEN CK2 IS CHEAPER AND A BIGGER AND A BETTER GAME? Why buy this crap? Don't support the money-grubbing wanna-be pimps.

DON'T SUPPORT THE SCUM MERCHANTS. Don't buy rotting fish at the market, don't buy a rotting game from a dishonest broker. Save your money. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.",False,english,76561198103349403,230.2,2024-09-25 03:01:39

Extremely fun game but I rally disagree with Paradox's method of monetization. Some key mechanics that are considered fundamental for a playing experience are locked behind expensive DLC. Sure, 30$ might not mean much when you're american and you can probably spend at least 60$ every month with entertainment expenses, but in the case of most of the third world, the price is not properly adapted to our financial realities, most DLC costs more than 10% of my monthly income.

Ignoring that fact, I hate the continuous push for online gameplay.
I'm not an online player. I like to play offline. Alone.
Ultimate Team is kind of addictive and Squad Battles was my favorite mode since it was introduced. Rush sadly is another online mode, adding to the already never ending list of online modes. Squad Battles was the only decent mode for me.
But it seems EA decided to nerf/kill it by decreasing the Squad Battles weekly games from 32 to 14!!!
I can't personally understand the reasoning behind this.
Why does every FC player need to play online? Do I have to rely on Career mode? Or just Kick-off?

Pros:
-Fantastic lore/world building
-Fantastic gameplay
-Huge world with things to do
-Great graphics/art direction
-Phenomenal soundtrack 
-Easy to get into for casual gamers, with plentiful options to make the game significantly easier

Cons:
-PC stuttering caused by shader compilation
-Certain bosses reward good RNG for a run instead of only outplaying them, however every boss is beatable with pure skill alone even if the boss uses their hardest/cheesiest moves. For example beating Malenia felt more like getting a good run than out-skilling her,
-World is vast but does not reward exploration for your specific build (i.e. there's no point in exploring if you already have a build in mind with specific talismans, etc.). Basically if there's nothing you need in a certain area then there's no point going there except for leveling purposes.
-Final boss of the main game is one of the worst main bosses

My Build:
-Melee only strength/stagger build with a two-handed colossal great sword, lion's claw, talismans that boost this playstyle, no summons, no cheesing bosses

Not too familiar with it personally, so it was a nice breath of fresh air. 

The combat is fun and there's a lot of build variety. Sometimes the controls can feel a bit janky (feels like commands aren't queued up properly if your character is busy in an animation so it feels like you have to spam buttons to get one command out sometimes).

The story was relatively interesting. The end chapter animations were a huge highlight and a wonderful little decompression moment after the (usually) intense chapter end bosses.

Areas looked very beautiful but I definitely felt like level design itself was a bit lacking (even if the environments were gorgeous). Some areas dragged on for far too long and were kind of samey (chapter 5 really felt like it would never end). 

Overall, I definitely enjoyed the game and felt like the time I spent with it was worth it. I'm looking forward to the DLC.

The Terry Bogart DLC has just released and the pattern is now clear: They are not trying to create a balanced eSport, but are releasing OP characters to sell DLC!

Every new DLC character release is like a recreation of the Stanford Prison Experiment.  Half the players switch to the new character and get to be wardens, and half the players stick with their main character and get to be prisoners.

Having to fight a constant loop of Terry, Bison, and Akuma is not fun any more.   The only successful DLC characters were Ed and Aki.  They were different enough to attract some attention, but not so overpowered that everyone switched to them.  The pattern with Akuma, Bison, and now Terry is clear.

Every match feels challenging but still winnable, it's not a snowball-fest like other games.

There's serious hype potential in every match, and the characters are varied and fun to learn.
The netcode has been pretty good to me so far, and the battle hub is hilarious to behold.

Frost Punk 2 has several significant issues and it is hard for me to recommend the game to anyone who is a major fan of Frost Punk 1.  Overall the game is not bad, and many aspects are actually very good but there are several major pain points the drag the current state of the game down.

[b]Minor contextual spoilers ahead, you have been warned[/b]

[h2]Tutorials (or lack thereof)[/h2]
The story starts with what seems to be the intended tutorial but really the chapter is barely able to be called a tutorial.  This is mainly because the opening chapter only covers a small fraction of the game with the rest of the tutorial tucked away in a purely text/image tutorial window.  This tutorial documentation is actually good and does a decent job of explaining the remaining aspects of the game, but it is so detached from the rest of the game that I would be surprised if most players open it, as is up to the player to break out of the immersion of the game to read the tutorial documentation.  It is completely breaking of the game, and really a failure on 11-bit's part to not integrate the tutorial better.  The sad part is, we known they can integrate a tutorial into the natural flow of the game as that is how Frost Punk 1 worked.  Small pop-ups and events that happen in Frost Punk 1 guide the player and introduce new mechanics in a natural and well defined way, but sadly Frost Punk 2 forgoes all of this, instead condemning the player to break their immersion and spent time reading the tutorial instead of playing the game.

[h2]UI (Why is Everything White?)[/h2]
For a game that is set on largely white background, with largely white features, it is strange that the UI is also largely white or grey.  Generally, it is hard to read the, otherwise very gorgeous and well done UI, because everything just tends to blend into each other.  [spoiler]For instance, frost breaking, the act of breaking up the snow/ice so you can build there, requires the users to select tiles that are marked bright white, from tiles that either grey (already broken) or not as bright white (not accessible tiles).[/spoiler]  I generally am not sure how a visually impaired person is able to play this game as so many elements of the UI just blend in with each other.

The game does come with a dark mode, but the developers decided to throw a warning in that turning on dark mode will result in a lost of UI look and feel.  I guess the devs are trying to warn that dark mode is not the intended way to play, but if that is truly the case then maybe the devs should re-evaluate why they felt the need to include dark mode in the first place.  Additionally, for some reason dark mode does degrade some of the few colored elements in the UI, to monotone colors, which just seems completely unnecessary.  

[h2]Performance (Another New Game, Another Example of Terrible Launch Performance)[/h2]
The game tricks the user into thinking that the game will perform well as the initial half of a play through tends to play very well.  Movement is fluid, clicks are responsive, and saves are not disruptive, but somewhere around the half way point everything starts to fall apart.  

Take saving, the game defaults to auto-saving at regular intervals and, importantly, the game is completely frozen while a save is happening.  At first, this minor inconvenience as the auto-save will freeze the game for a second and is generally not an issue, but as the city grows the time it takes to save also grows.  This ultimately culminates in 30+ second long save times when in the late game (all saves are to SSDs).  This is exasperated by the auto-save feature which makes it very frustrating to be dealing with a crisis in the game and then suddenly everything stops, you can't click on anything, you can't do anything, but look at the ""<saving...>"" window and wait, and wait, and wait....  The save performance completely breaks the immersion, and I ultimately thought about turning off auto-saves because it was so disruptive, but doing so would have made the random crashes much more painful.

What would a game launch be without random, game breaking, crashes, and Frost Punk 2 has them in spades.  I will not go into all the issues the Mac community is having as I do not play on a Mac, but they are many and loud on the discord.  No, instead I will focus on my, and my partners, Windows play through.  There appears to be an issues with the game crashing when playing at max speed, and while I did not encounter many crashes, my partner did and they where to the point that they needed to save frequently (remember the save issue, yea, it is even worst when combined with the crashes).  The only main difference between our two devices, I have an Intel CPU, and my partner has an AMD CPU, so maybe there is an issue with AMD CPUs but I do not know for certain.  All I can say is that the same is completely unstable and you are basically forced to play with auto-immersion-breaking-saving on. 

The bright side, 11-bit has been working on trying to resolve these issues and I am hopeful that the issues will be resolved with patches in the coming days/weeks.

[h2]Frost Punk Soul (Where did it go?)[/h2]
All of the above issues with the game can be resolved with patches and updates over time, but the by far the biggest issue with Frost Punk 2 is the [i]almost[/i] lack of soul.  One of the great things about FP 1 is the decisions a player has to make just in who works where, do the children work in the mines (which they yearn for) or does it fall to an automaton?  These kinda of intimate interactions are completely missing from the game, instead [spoiler]districts pull from a generic pool of workers, are they children? Maybe.  They could also be automatons or the elderly, who knows![/spoiler]  These interactions, and others, are what made FP 1 so great and also so hard, but achievable.  I have hard a lot of players say that FP 2 is so much harder than FP 1 ever was, but I do not feel like that difficulty is truly because the game is harder.  Instead, the game generally feels harder not because it is harder, but because the player has significantly less tools to deal with any given crisis.  [spoiler]Instead, the player is left to building districts and sending out exploration teams, while occasionally throwing some stubborn party a gift/punishment to keep them from trying to tear everything down.[/spoiler]  Ultimately, the only time I felt truly moved or emotional was the very end of the story, which presents the player with an almost deep philosophical dive into the what is means to create a ""utopia"".   This is really the heart of FP 2 issues, the new scale of the game means that the intimate details that made FP 1 great are completely lost, and I am not sure there is a good way that can be fixed without some major redesigns.

[h2]Final Thoughts[/h2]
Generally, FP 2 is a good and unique city builder game, the additional content truly pushes the boundaries and fulfills some wishes of FP 1. Sadly FP 2 is not the gritty [b]survival[/b] city builder that FP 1, and that is why I have a hard time recommending this game anyone other than a purely city builder fan.  I really hope that 11-bit can find away to bring back in some the moral and heart felt soul of FP 1, but until then, FP 2 feel just like a shell of the greatness that is FP 1.",False,english,76561197983564021,14.166666666666666,2024-09-25 05:37:43

I think the problem with this one is the district system and gameplay mechanics makes city planning rather uninteresting. In the first game if something is well planned, you could temporarily at least be ""ahead of the curve"". In this installment, pretty much impossible at harder difficulty levels to have neutral or positive states across most of the supply categories, so you just constantly toggle which you want to get ahead in. Negative states don't feel that impactful. What I would expect is for things to fall apart, except not really. I had negative housing for the a long duration and what I would expect is hundreds to start dying, but it took too long for too little people to die.

Some of the gameplay needs improvement too. E.g.: ""not enough workforce to build building"", but I do have workforce, just not enough. If I have 99% of the necessary workforce for a building, I still want those 99% to do something not just sit around. So workaround is to temporarily turn something to lower efficiency %, use the extra workforce to build new building, then tune new building down to 99% and reallocate the 1% back to original building. Not fun. Old model was better. Queue them all up and if you queue too many that's your problem.

I only put about 60 hours into Frostpunk 1, but I was able to beat all of the campaign missions and DLCs on the 2nd highest difficulty. I became devoted to finally finishing them due to the immersion and difficulty. 

What 1 offered was a deeply immersive city builder where every choice you made, whether that was building something or a contextual event, could have a fairly significant impact on the entire play-through. 

Frostpunk 2 is something else entirely. There's no real connection with your ""citizens"" outside of the ""faction"" representatives. Nothing you do really seems to matter like it did in the first. Now, the overall gameplay is more similar to City Skylines than it is Frostpunk 1.

This game has been one of my most anticipated games this year, as it was for many others, and 11-Bit Studios did not disappoint. While the first game was about survival and enduring through the hardships of the severe cold, Frostpunk 2 is about the comeback of civilization. It's much more large scale, which I personally love, and more difficult to manage. I've found that this is more about managing society than the cold, even though it's still a major part of the game. The Laws that you approve or decline may not align with what certain factions believe in. You may have to negotiate with them to win their favor. All while still keeping the generator alive, and exploring the vast land around you.

Where in the first game you could try your hardest to hold on to what little there was to hold on to of sanity and morals, NOW, after 30 years, those decisions are now monthly, or weekly, or even daily. A group barely surviving the frost, now desires to conqueror it, tired of barely surviving.

The music building tension as the city crumbles over warring factions, you as the steward or in my case the Captain battling desperately to hold on just a bit more. But once all the warring is over you can achieve serenity and watch you society function. It is truly an amazing game and I seriously enjoyed this next entry.

You'll see a lot of reviews on here complaining that this diverted too much from what made Frostpunk great and you'll see a lot of people saying that the changes made here go in the wrong direction. I disagree. This game is still VERY Frostpunk: the game throws you into the frostland and you must keep the generator running and supplies coming all while the people of your city bicker and complain about the direction you take the city. The political side of Frostpunk 2 is vastly expanded on; passing laws and pleasing factions are far more important this time around. It is a core fundamental aspect of this sequel to delve into the political landscape of your city and carefully pick and choose which laws are passed and which factions to support. The final chapter of the campaign was so intense I literally can't remember a time where a game like this got me to that level of engagement and immersion. 

You'll learn A LOT about how to progress more successfully with each new city you make, whether it be trying the campaign on harder difficulties or picking different maps in the Utopia mode. I've now gone through three runs each with varying levels of success: the first one being marginally successful just enough to get by, the second one being vastly successful ensuring that my city stands long after I die, and the third crumbling from existence because of my inability to rule it properly. This game's insistence on forcing you to learn is extremely engaging and it really is the key reason why I can see myself putting dozens of more hours into this. 

Exploring the frostland and building resource outposts, surviving the blizzards, and ensuring every faction has their voice heard all make for a gameplay system that constantly keeps you engaged and really never gives you a dull moment. Each new run on a new map presents new challenges and new opportunities. 

While many will be disappointed that this isn't the same as Frostpunk 1, I think the evolution made in this entry still makes it extremely engaging and I have high hopes for the future of this franchise.

Nothing really matters anymore. Death? It used to make me cringe everytime I'd hear the bell in the first game.

You can find them all over the frostland, plus you get population growth. 

Also, the main plot? It kinda sucks honestly. At least the ending I got. I pledged to overpower the cold and restore a warm spot. But I didn't even get to see anything cool out of it! All the sacrifice, all the voices I suppressed. And I didn't even get to see like, plants growing or the local climate actually warming! All I did was burn extra fuel for literally nothing in return.

You can't create a ""utopia"" with one vision. Well guess what? It's STUPID. This is not a deep, enriching experience.
