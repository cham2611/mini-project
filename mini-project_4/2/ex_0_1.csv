This game is hard, like vary hard, if you are new you will die a lot to older players.  So here are a few things you can do to get better at the game.

1. Don't cheat.  You will not get better if you do cheat and you will make the game worse by doing so.
2. Listen to your surroundings.  This can make you win or loss a game just because you could not hear where the other players shots are coming from so you put your back towards the player shooting at you instead of facing them.
3. Do not land at popular sites, this is an easy and fast way to go back to the lobby, instead look for locations at least 1km from where the plane is flying and go there.
4. Play with friends and use VOIP.  You can use the in game VOIP, but what I use is Discord.
5. Don't go more then 100 m from your team mates.  This way when one of you is in trouble, 3 of your team mates are at positions to aid you.  Also don't be to close to each other, as this makes you easier to spot and makes it harder for you and your team mates to return fire when you are in a fire fight.
6. When you see someone, ping them so your team mates know where they are and can aid it taking them down.
7. Take a automatic weapon and a long range weapon (DMR or SR).  My suggestion for a new player is a SMG and a DMR.  For SMG use one of the 3, UMP, VECTOR, MP5K.  As for DMR's, use SLR or DRAGUNOV.
8. Carry at least 4 First Aid kits, 10 bandages, and 4 boosts.
9. Carry 2-3 Smoke grenades.
10. Just have fun.

Will change to a thumbs up once they've added new servers in hopefully this game continues to grow as I have high hopes for it!

UPDATE: Pretty disappointed at how the management is with this game as they try to do a lot of banning and not to mention banning stream snipers instead of focusing more time on actually trying to open new servers up so to get more exposure for the game.....Right now it's kind of a turn off so decided to uninstall it.

UPDATE 2: The good news is that other servers are up but unfortunately it's leaving players wants to support that are in the Oceania region super dead clearly the devs should be more transparent about this so now they just seem to avoid the question all together........",False,english

All the RPG elements you'd expect, fully voiced, great post-release maintenance/commitment and in a truly interesting non-fanstasy setting. The mechanics don't really mirror Cyberpunk 2020 or Cyberpunk: RED TTRPGs; while unfortunate, the mechanics in this game are solid.

And best of all, the game very moddable with a vibrant, engaged, and productive mod community.

Only disappointing aspect was that it has no 3rd person. You cannot see the character of the story, you cannot see their cool moves and action. Rather it's like you, the player at the computer, is there rather than the character of the story. And it wasn't immediately apparent how this weakens the whole experience.

But other than that there are only two minor points of weakness, both addressable in the mature product:
1. Boss fights assume certain style of play--the dev's preference. This is solvable by mods.
2. CDPR having their favorite story ending and putting weak effort into other endings because you should have thought like the devs and writers to get the best endgame experience [see Witcher 3]. This is solvable by research and then playing the fleshed out single ending CDPR envisioned.

Everything else is top notch, engaging, and fun. Has all the RPG elements you'd expect and good quests, decent story lines. DLC is lacking, but they did release one at least--it's also very decent; almost more interesting than the main storyline [again, see Witcher 3].

The World of Cyberpunk 2077 is a dark and gritty one. A dystopian but but also real future where you're either rich or barely surviving. but what makes this game beautiful is, despite it all, you keep fighting for a better life, never fully loosing hope even at your lowest of lows. the game shows this with not only your character but also the supporting cast. Characters who often seem hard and tuff like the city has forced them to be opening up to you and being vurnurable to you as you get to know them. Judy, Panam, heck even Johnny Silverhand. all characters who I will remember and cherish.

Now as to the gameplay when this game first came out it was, and I pardon my language, Dogshit... But ever since the 2.0 update they overhauled everything and somehow did a complete 180! With the gunplay going from feeling unimpactful and bland to OOMPHY in the best way possible and then the upgrade system acually feeling worth it with new abilities and customization to make truly unique and fun builds all of which are viable! I personaly love fully upgrading reflexes allowing me to dash and dodge around both on ground and mid-air for some really fun almost bullethell like movement or going for a more stealth build allowing you to quickly take out enemy bases and finish gigs with a quick swipe reall assassin style! just a few of the many ways to play the game and I can practically garantee that there is a playstyle for you! So much fun.

The music is also amazing and somethign I wanna highlight as a producer myself. It really perfected what Cyberpunk should sound like. It's drone like nature with these elements of punk music really fusing together in such a unique way! It just has this tensity to it that just feels suspenseful. Then there's the action music which I swear I would be so much stealthier if it didn't go as hard as it goes cuz DAMN it makes me pumped! It's so intense and adrenaline filled and fits so well to every senario! truly spectacular.
but the best tracks in the game for me are the more quiet ones. the ones that play in somber or joyful moments. the themes of the characters you meet. Johnnys theme using a cello/violin making it sound like a guitar somehow is just beautiful and really shows another side of johnny in a way. and leidmotives of ""never fade away"" (a song by Johnnys band) playing at just the right times making it almost a theme of sorts for the events that it plays in. I dunno It just adds so much to the imersion and I can't get enough of it.

And don't even get me started on the DLC. Phantom Liberty is one of the best expansions I have ever played. The district of Dogtown is dense and full of fun activities to do, but once again the highlights are the characters. Somehow they're even deeper than before, feeling like acual people who all have unique motives and personalities that when it came time to choose I couldn't decide cuz I cared so much for all of them. I wanted the best for all of them but due to the nature of the story (which i won't spoil) I could'nt and it was heartbreaking, but it also felt beautiful in a way. Just absolutly phenomenal story telling and a story I will never forget.

In the end I would personally highly recommend this game. It's a game I always come back to replay, a world that I can't get enough of and one of those games that gave me something I'll keep for the rest of my life. It might take some time to get into but trust me once ur in it will be an experience you will never forget. an experience that, despite it's dark nature, made me feel hope. A thing of beauty for sure.

and a thing of beauty will never fade away...
Keep fighting",True,english

The main story is staged in Night City, an open-world sandbox with a mix of neo-noir and ganster movie characters and narratives. While the DLC's is significantly smaller in scope, it's a tight, well written spy thriller that keeps some of the same beats (the heist elements) but remains fresh with new stakes and an interesting cast.
The RPG is well implemented: in addition to ""cyberware"" -interchangeable parts that influence your controls, movements patterns, weapon affinity and some gameplay interactions, you have 3 main variables that make for very deep character building: Attributes, Perks and Skills.
You have 5 main Attributes- each Attributes will have its own ""Perk"" tree. Raising an Attribute (up to a max of 20) will unlock more (and better) Perks. Attributes mostly have an influence on weapon proficiency and some interactions, but will also impact how you approach certain missions. Will you break the door? Can you hack the door? Can you stay hidden or will you ram through? The 3D environment of Night City helps you tackle situations with a wide variety of possible solutions.
While the ""Attributes"" can only be reset once per game, the Perks can be refunded and distributed again as many times as you wish outside combat, encouraging experimentation. You can see which weapons work best for you, how your perks interact with each other and your cybernetic implants.
The Skills progress naturally- anytime you perform an action, take down an enemy with a certain weapon, pass a dialogue or Attribute check- the related Skill will increase. Up to a max of 50, every 5 levels you will unlock a permanent boost.

I think the main downside to the game is how long it is- not all missions are created equal and sometimes it's a drag or a bit of a bore, but those moments are few and sandwiched between thrilling combat sequence. Didn't particularly care for the DB elements either.

Overall 9/10, the few narrative lapses or repetitive nature of some missions didn't spoil my fun enough to bring the score lower than that. I would just add that the soundtrack is a constant banger and is very serviceable to the story.",True,english

It’s Dark Souls on steroids—only this time, the world is so massive, you can get lost in it for hours, just to stumble upon something even more soul-crushing than the last boss that wrecked you. And you’ll love every second of it.

The combat? Oh, it’s brutal. Every enemy looks like it crawled straight out of a nightmare, designed to make sure you second-guess every decision you’ve ever made. But when you finally land that perfect parry or take down that seemingly impossible boss, it’s like a rush of adrenaline straight to your veins. You’ve earned that win, and no one can take it from you. But don’t get cocky, because this game lives to humble you. Every. Single. Time.

The world? A sprawling fever dream of chaos, beauty, and terror all rolled into one. You can’t explore for more than five minutes without being ambushed by something monstrous, and yet you’ll keep pushing forward, eyes wide, because the environment just dares you to see what’s around the next corner. And trust me, it’s usually something that wants to rip your face off.

The story? Classic FromSoftware—vague and scattered across cryptic lore, but somehow dripping with dark allure. You’ll spend hours piecing it together, and even when you think you’ve got it, the game leaves you with more questions than answers. But honestly, the story isn’t what keeps you coming back. It’s the challenge. It’s the thrill of dying 30 times in the same spot, only to finally crack the code and make that zone your kingdom.

The open world is your playground, and by playground, I mean death trap. There are no hand-holds here—no map markers to coddle you, no easy routes. You explore at your own risk, and most of the time, you’ll pay for that curiosity with your life. But that’s the beauty of Elden Ring. It doesn’t care about your feelings. It wants you to fight, to suffer, to overcome.

Is it frustrating? Hell yes. Is it worth every moment of that frustration? Absolutely. Elden Ring will drag you through the mud, but by the end, you’ll feel like you conquered the impossible. You’ll wear every scar from this game with pride, and that’s why it’s a masterpiece. It doesn’t just test your skills—it tests your will. And if you survive, you’ll walk away feeling like a god.",True,english

I've been playing Blizzard games since I got Starcraft: Broodwar for free with a PC mag back in the day. I've played every game in the Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo franchises. Blizzard lost their way for a while but Diablo 4 is a return to form.

I bought this game less than a week ago, I've played about 40 hours and I'm already done with this season's battlepass and most of the main seasonal content. Yeah, I've been playing Blizz games for years, I know all their tricks and mechanics, but the fact that I could complete the seasonal content in under 40 hours is a massive thing for me as a gamer. I don't want to be forced to play every day, or every week, just to grind hours playing the game to make sure I finish the battlepass or whatever.

The game itself is as good a hack n slash as I've played, I wish that games didn't have to be so restrictive these days with giving out spells and abilities, just because console gamers are stuck on their useless controllers that can't handle more than 4 active abilities, but that's the world we live in. At least Diablo 4 lets you have 6 spells/actions!!!! Thats 50% more than most games!

The story, as always with Diablo is top notch, I'm not a fan of single player campaigns in general but I've always loved Blizzard campaigns, I dunno, they just get me.

amazing.
a few bad bosses, nothing a avg person cant manage.
needs to work on the progression of the game, I feel like I cant wear a armor set that's actually cool because you unlock a new craft every 1-2 hours and most of the time they are way better than what ever armor set you crafted before that. 
the combat is great and I feel like there is a lot of build variety especially when you get some of the mythical staffs. 
the game is long and great. ~50 hours for me to beat 6 chapters, and get the true ending so :)...

7/10.

The action component is solid, but the second half of the game falters:
1. Hit box issues plague many boss fights, specifically the disparity between visual cues and actual hit boxes, leading to frustrating encounters. While abilities are questionable, they seem designed for newcomers to the genre.
2. Despite featuring numerous bosses and mini-bosses, only a handful leave a lasting impression.
3. Visually, the game impresses... for about two chapters.

Censorship nearly ruined the experience, as there's a hidden storyline that's difficult to grasp without familiarity with Chinese culture. In essence, Wukong embodies the spirit of anti-establishment, questioning the status quo, and defying authority. These ideas come from Chinese myths and social issues, and they could have made the game's story much deeper. But because of strict censorship, these ideas are buried so deep in the game's background and symbols that they're almost impossible to spot. Players have to guess what things mean, trying to put together the story from tiny hints and cultural clues that are hard to catch. This isn't a fun puzzle to solve - it's a messy story that's been forced to hide its true meaning. Even people who know a lot about Chinese culture might have trouble figuring out what the game is really trying to say.

It appears that an additional ending exists which would clarify many of these(From developer's interviews.), but due to censorship constraints, the developers were unable to include it in the released version, further fragmenting the intended narrative experience.

I would still recommend this title to action game enthusiasts, but it's hard to justify a score above 7.",True,english

There are 3 game modes in Space Marine 2. A campaign, a PvE entitled Operations, and a PvP entitled Eternal War. Campaign is alright, no real issues found there. But the bulk of your gameplay is gonna happen in PvE and PvP. In my eyes, PvP is clunky. It plays similar to Gears of War in that it feels very rigid. Except it lacks what makes GoW combat tolerable and interesting: Cover mechanics, shoulder swapping, and just about anything that makes it fluid. The classes are balanced in that they're all unbalanced. The time-to-kill is incredibly inconsistent. Some times it'll take a couple well placed headshots to take somebody out, sometimes you can unload half a magazine at the same distance and it still won't put them down. Parrying offers barely any benefit, and the tracking for melee is abhorrent a majority of the time. As for PvE, most of those issues don't apply. However, what does currently plague both online game modes is that the matchmaking is so ungodly horrible that it can take upwards of 15-20 minutes to find a lobby. The PvP isn't as bad, but the PvE sometimes simply stops searching for players, or only puts you with one other player and then stops searching. For the most part the gameplay is tolerable, but a lot of issues arise when you try to actually get into matches online.",True,english

Worst part about it is the unplayable state the game is in unless you have a super beefed up computer. then consider yourself shit out of luck. What will you will run into is performance issues and i mean performance issues out the ass. from the time i started the game i sat in black screen for 10 minutes after those 10 minutes i then saw the opening credits for saber interactive the warhammer logo ect. i then got to the pretexture shading loading screen sat there for 20 minuts while that loaded. sat an extra 15 for the resources of the game to load. Initaly think it might be a first time start up thing. i got the title screen hit the enter button only to then wait 10 minuts for it to go the next screen. Upon the campaign starting initialy getting to the first opening cinamatic. the screen freezes with the sounds of the cinamatic playing in the background. only to crash. Upon starting the game up a 2nd time i experienced the same exact as above. this time upon getting to title screen. I hit continue and the cinamatic froze continued to play without the frames or cinamatic changing only to jump to the point where the protagnist character is taken control of. My thoughts were what the fuck why am i not able to see the cinamatic play out from start to finish without a problem. Having quit the campaign and starting another one i ran into the crashing problem agian. upon starting up a third time experiencing the above a third time. and getting to the title screen i set the graphics and video settings to performance. and to the lowest quality graphics settings. only to experience the opening cinamatic to crash agian.

After finally folding and purchasing the base game at a discount, I quickly grew to love the combat system, methods of gaining power, and especially the story the game told. The most important part of any game to me is the story, followed by the combat mechanics, then the graphics. Cyberpunk smashed all my expectations so much so that I purchased Phantom Liberty at full price when I was halfway through the game, solely because I knew I wanted more content before the end of the game. I'm very glad I did. The DLC has been wonderful, and without spoiling it, I would rate it 2 tiers above the base game (7/10 - base, 9/10 DlC, for an average of 8/10). Note that 5/10 simply means ""average"" and reasonable for the experience/price. I fully recommend the DLC if you enjoyed the base game.",True,english

1. For some reason, when the chase starts and you get hit by a car and continue driving, we did not continue. Our car got pushed to the gate and didn't move. I had to restart.
2. Then when you start fighting scavs, it's needlessly hard. It's my 2nd playthrough, on hard difficulty. On hard, I killed Adam Smasher on 2nd try at just lvl 35 with sucky cyberware, and I'd say Adam Smasher is one of the hardest bosses in the game. This thing took me 5 tries. My advice -- when you get out of car, you get blades. Forget the blades, get back to pistol, find cover and be very careful as they'll shred you very quickly. Be careful with skulls and netrunners. First time I got killed by a runner.
3. After finally doing this, I go to the ""wounded scav"" and... nothing happens. It's bugged again. Trust me, I tried everything and I don't think I did anything unusual to cause it. 

At this point I just lost it. Come on, The DLC had been out for a year now, and the base game is 4 years old at this point. I understand that making games of this scale is hard.

The dlc is its own thing pretty much with an extra ending of its own, which has the added benefit of skipping the remainder of the core vidya.

Now, onto the good things: the script, the pacing, the dialogues, the execution of a properly polished thriller. The DLC adds some extra missions for old fixers. Fetch quests aside, the quest are good too, adding depth and nuance to the NPCs. Though the most important is the selection of end-game choices you're presented with. Between wetwork, dubious loyalties and complex motivations of dramatis personaes, someone did their homework on intelligence services so a lot of it offers a very authentic experience. A lot of times you leave feeling dirty - because that is the nature of the work. My only criticism is you couldn't off Meyers (it'd be tons of fun, I think), but otherwise it's next to excellent. Johnny's dialogue at the end of the lunar escape was a rare gem, diverging from his usual abrasive rants. Meeting Mr Hands in person was somewhat of a letdown, but more gigs from the sphinxian villain was welcome.

It's difficult to believe the DLC was produced by the same studio as the cliché and filth-filled dumpster fire that is the core game. The setting remains as disgusting as ever, with humanity locked in a dull and primitive state of neo-feudal corporate overlords or communes of plain-roaming barbarians, but Phantom Liberty redeems the price tag. If you find a way to skip to the DLC and just play the extra, do it: it is a real treat for any lovers of a spy drama - something Deux Ex tried and failed to do.

Edit: ending credits animation film was an outstanding tribute to the classic James Bond movies. Stellar.",True,english

Imagine if James Bond, Keanu Reeves, and Idris Elba decided to throw a party in Night City, and you get to clean up the mess. That’s Phantom Liberty for you.

The expansion kicks off with the President of the New United States crash-landing in Dogtown. Yes, you read that right. Apparently, Air Force One now comes with a “crash here for plot development” button. You’re hired to rescue her, but not before you navigate through a maze of cybernetic baddies, morally ambiguous choices, and enough plot twists to make a pretzel jealous.

Idris Elba’s character, Solomon Reed, is the secret agent we all wish we could be. He’s suave, he’s mysterious, and he probably has a better skincare routine than you. Meanwhile, Keanu Reeves returns as Johnny Silverhand, still rocking that “I hate the system” vibe but with a touch more existential dread. It’s like watching your cool uncle go through a mid-life crisis, but with more explosions.

Dogtown itself is a marvel. It’s like someone took all the worst parts of a dystopian future and decided to make it a tourist attraction. The local wildlife includes cyber-enhanced gangsters and vending machines that might just try to sell you a grenade. But hey, at least the street food is to die for—literally.

The gameplay is a rollercoaster of emotions. One moment you’re making life-or-death decisions, the next you’re wondering why your character’s pants have suddenly disappeared. It’s all part of the Cyberpunk experience, folks. Embrace the chaos.

In conclusion, Phantom Liberty is the perfect blend of high-stakes drama, cybernetic mayhem, and unintentional comedy. It’s like a soap opera set in a dystopian future, and honestly, we wouldn’t have it any other way. So, grab your cyberdeck, put on your best trench coat, and dive into the madness. Just watch out for those vending machines.",True,english

This game is hard, like vary hard, if you are new you will die a lot to older players.  So here are a few things you can do to get better at the game.

1. Don't cheat.  You will not get better if you do cheat and you will make the game worse by doing so.
2. Listen to your surroundings.  This can make you win or loss a game just because you could not hear where the other players shots are coming from so you put your back towards the player shooting at you instead of facing them.
3. Do not land at popular sites, this is an easy and fast way to go back to the lobby, instead look for locations at least 1km from where the plane is flying and go there.
4. Play with friends and use VOIP.  You can use the in game VOIP, but what I use is Discord.
5. Don't go more then 100 m from your team mates.  This way when one of you is in trouble, 3 of your team mates are at positions to aid you.  Also don't be to close to each other, as this makes you easier to spot and makes it harder for you and your team mates to return fire when you are in a fire fight.
6. When you see someone, ping them so your team mates know where they are and can aid it taking them down.
7. Take a automatic weapon and a long range weapon (DMR or SR).  My suggestion for a new player is a SMG and a DMR.  For SMG use one of the 3, UMP, VECTOR, MP5K.  As for DMR's, use SLR or DRAGUNOV.
8. Carry at least 4 First Aid kits, 10 bandages, and 4 boosts.
9. Carry 2-3 Smoke grenades.
10. Just have fun.

Will change to a thumbs up once they've added new servers in hopefully this game continues to grow as I have high hopes for it!

UPDATE: Pretty disappointed at how the management is with this game as they try to do a lot of banning and not to mention banning stream snipers instead of focusing more time on actually trying to open new servers up so to get more exposure for the game.....Right now it's kind of a turn off so decided to uninstall it.

The game immerses you in a way that few can, combining its gripping story, breathtaking visuals, and impeccable soundtrack to pull you into the dystopian Night City. There were countless times where I would just stop to look around and take in the gorgeous views.

I found the blend of FPS and RPG elements to be very fun and engaging. Building up V's strength throughout the game was particularly satisfying for me, particularly in how it can interplay with the narrative, even if on the smaller side. Difficulty wise I thought it was pretty balanced overall. It does get on the easier side of things from mid to late game but I don't mind that at all. The game is limited to first person, which I didn't mind after awhile. It's an FPS after all. 
Overall, I loved the high octane, high stakes approach it takes to its combat.

I did not play this game when it first launched, so I have no idea what issues from release still remain. I can however report on the problems I did find regularly:
- Poor LOD Rendering
There were many times, particularly after installing the Phantom Liberty DLC, where the game's engine struggled a lot with loading LODs properly. I mainly noticed it with the NPCs and vehicles, especially when driving, where they would load at very low detail until you're like a few steps away. Rarely when driving, the road can just unload for some reason and become invisible for a couple seconds, which can really screw with you. This is pretty uncommon though.
- Low Traffic Density While Driving
When you're not driving around the city, the traffic is pretty normal. However, once you start going at high speeds on the road, traffic seems to diminish significantly. This does create an uncanny result considering its supposed to be a mega city. It seems the game does this to further save on resources, but it is still somewhat distracting how little traffic there can be.
- Vehicle Summoning
The game allows you to call your vehicle, and it will drive itself to you. Even to this day, the menu for this still says the feature is in beta. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any plans to properly finish it. Now, I bring this up because a lot of the time, the place that it chooses to spawn your car is..not great. Sometimes it will spawn on another road that's like a block away, and other times it spawns it in other vehicles. But on occasion, the car may straight up spawn in the air, where you can watch it gracefully tumble all the way to the ground. Other than traditional fast travel, cars and motorcycles are the de facto way to get around Night City, so a feature like this should probably have had more time in the oven.

Despite those recurring issues I had, they are nowhere near game breaking. They only hurt the already amazing immersion a bit. I did not really experience any crashes before installing mods, so those issues seem to be gone. In all, I definitely think the game is in a good place now. If you were thinking about getting Cyberpunk for yourself, I highly recommend it.",True,english

All the RPG elements you'd expect, fully voiced, great post-release maintenance/commitment and in a truly interesting non-fanstasy setting. The mechanics don't really mirror Cyberpunk 2020 or Cyberpunk: RED TTRPGs; while unfortunate, the mechanics in this game are solid.

And best of all, the game very moddable with a vibrant, engaged, and productive mod community.

Only disappointing aspect was that it has no 3rd person. You cannot see the character of the story, you cannot see their cool moves and action. Rather it's like you, the player at the computer, is there rather than the character of the story. And it wasn't immediately apparent how this weakens the whole experience.

But other than that there are only two minor points of weakness, both addressable in the mature product:
1. Boss fights assume certain style of play--the dev's preference. This is solvable by mods.
2. CDPR having their favorite story ending and putting weak effort into other endings because you should have thought like the devs and writers to get the best endgame experience [see Witcher 3]. This is solvable by research and then playing the fleshed out single ending CDPR envisioned.

Everything else is top notch, engaging, and fun. Has all the RPG elements you'd expect and good quests, decent story lines. DLC is lacking, but they did release one at least--it's also very decent; almost more interesting than the main storyline [again, see Witcher 3].

The World of Cyberpunk 2077 is a dark and gritty one. A dystopian but but also real future where you're either rich or barely surviving. but what makes this game beautiful is, despite it all, you keep fighting for a better life, never fully loosing hope even at your lowest of lows. the game shows this with not only your character but also the supporting cast. Characters who often seem hard and tuff like the city has forced them to be opening up to you and being vurnurable to you as you get to know them. Judy, Panam, heck even Johnny Silverhand. all characters who I will remember and cherish.

Now as to the gameplay when this game first came out it was, and I pardon my language, Dogshit... But ever since the 2.0 update they overhauled everything and somehow did a complete 180! With the gunplay going from feeling unimpactful and bland to OOMPHY in the best way possible and then the upgrade system acually feeling worth it with new abilities and customization to make truly unique and fun builds all of which are viable! I personaly love fully upgrading reflexes allowing me to dash and dodge around both on ground and mid-air for some really fun almost bullethell like movement or going for a more stealth build allowing you to quickly take out enemy bases and finish gigs with a quick swipe reall assassin style! just a few of the many ways to play the game and I can practically garantee that there is a playstyle for you! So much fun.

The music is also amazing and somethign I wanna highlight as a producer myself. It really perfected what Cyberpunk should sound like. It's drone like nature with these elements of punk music really fusing together in such a unique way! It just has this tensity to it that just feels suspenseful. Then there's the action music which I swear I would be so much stealthier if it didn't go as hard as it goes cuz DAMN it makes me pumped! It's so intense and adrenaline filled and fits so well to every senario! truly spectacular.
but the best tracks in the game for me are the more quiet ones. the ones that play in somber or joyful moments. the themes of the characters you meet. Johnnys theme using a cello/violin making it sound like a guitar somehow is just beautiful and really shows another side of johnny in a way. and leidmotives of ""never fade away"" (a song by Johnnys band) playing at just the right times making it almost a theme of sorts for the events that it plays in. I dunno It just adds so much to the imersion and I can't get enough of it.

And don't even get me started on the DLC. Phantom Liberty is one of the best expansions I have ever played. The district of Dogtown is dense and full of fun activities to do, but once again the highlights are the characters. Somehow they're even deeper than before, feeling like acual people who all have unique motives and personalities that when it came time to choose I couldn't decide cuz I cared so much for all of them. I wanted the best for all of them but due to the nature of the story (which i won't spoil) I could'nt and it was heartbreaking, but it also felt beautiful in a way. Just absolutly phenomenal story telling and a story I will never forget.

In the end I would personally highly recommend this game. It's a game I always come back to replay, a world that I can't get enough of and one of those games that gave me something I'll keep for the rest of my life. It might take some time to get into but trust me once ur in it will be an experience you will never forget. an experience that, despite it's dark nature, made me feel hope. A thing of beauty for sure.

and a thing of beauty will never fade away...
Keep fighting",True,english

The main story is staged in Night City, an open-world sandbox with a mix of neo-noir and ganster movie characters and narratives. While the DLC's is significantly smaller in scope, it's a tight, well written spy thriller that keeps some of the same beats (the heist elements) but remains fresh with new stakes and an interesting cast.
The RPG is well implemented: in addition to ""cyberware"" -interchangeable parts that influence your controls, movements patterns, weapon affinity and some gameplay interactions, you have 3 main variables that make for very deep character building: Attributes, Perks and Skills.
You have 5 main Attributes- each Attributes will have its own ""Perk"" tree. Raising an Attribute (up to a max of 20) will unlock more (and better) Perks. Attributes mostly have an influence on weapon proficiency and some interactions, but will also impact how you approach certain missions. Will you break the door? Can you hack the door? Can you stay hidden or will you ram through? The 3D environment of Night City helps you tackle situations with a wide variety of possible solutions.
While the ""Attributes"" can only be reset once per game, the Perks can be refunded and distributed again as many times as you wish outside combat, encouraging experimentation. You can see which weapons work best for you, how your perks interact with each other and your cybernetic implants.
The Skills progress naturally- anytime you perform an action, take down an enemy with a certain weapon, pass a dialogue or Attribute check- the related Skill will increase. Up to a max of 50, every 5 levels you will unlock a permanent boost.

I think the main downside to the game is how long it is- not all missions are created equal and sometimes it's a drag or a bit of a bore, but those moments are few and sandwiched between thrilling combat sequence. Didn't particularly care for the DB elements either.

Overall 9/10, the few narrative lapses or repetitive nature of some missions didn't spoil my fun enough to bring the score lower than that. I would just add that the soundtrack is a constant banger and is very serviceable to the story.",True,english

amazing.
a few bad bosses, nothing a avg person cant manage.
needs to work on the progression of the game, I feel like I cant wear a armor set that's actually cool because you unlock a new craft every 1-2 hours and most of the time they are way better than what ever armor set you crafted before that. 
the combat is great and I feel like there is a lot of build variety especially when you get some of the mythical staffs. 
the game is long and great. ~50 hours for me to beat 6 chapters, and get the true ending so :)...

probably going to buy the dlc when ever it comes out, which is very soon actually because the base game was supposed to have like 11 chapters and most of the chapters had most of the design done",True,english

Everyone complained that something new was needed.

So then for years, game developers tried everything they could think of to change the gaming paradigm into not just something different than the classic game modes, but how to monetize the crap out of it while pushing their own political narrative and morals. Everyone complained about how this sucked, and we missed the good old days of campaign, multi player PvE, and PvP. No monetizing the crap out of us, and no political agendas to be found.

Space Marine 2 is a fantastic return to the ""good old days."" No agendas, just game lore followed. Hack and slash with a smattering of strategy. Classic game modes and game play.

My very low end computer has some trouble running the game, nonetheless I will not say that adds any negative remarks on the game; I made a poor investment for gaming. Luckily I have friends who let me play on their consoles and experience the game.

The Story is not over bearing with characters speech that adds nothing to the game. A casual gamer looking for a couch co-op game can jump into the story and understand the general idea of what is happening and enjoy the story. Furthermore, someone who is decently well versed in the grim dark universe will appreciate characters building upon the setting and making the player feel as if they are apart of a multi planet defense against heretical xenos.

The game play is not exactly casual, offering a challenge to players that can be overcome with most any game play style chosen. The game brings back a hack and slash, co-op gamer missed by many of gamers. The combat is executed in a cinematic world built with care to detail, with brutal combat and satisfying finishers.

After finally folding and purchasing the base game at a discount, I quickly grew to love the combat system, methods of gaining power, and especially the story the game told. The most important part of any game to me is the story, followed by the combat mechanics, then the graphics. Cyberpunk smashed all my expectations so much so that I purchased Phantom Liberty at full price when I was halfway through the game, solely because I knew I wanted more content before the end of the game. I'm very glad I did. The DLC has been wonderful, and without spoiling it, I would rate it 2 tiers above the base game (7/10 - base, 9/10 DlC, for an average of 8/10).

On hard, I killed Adam Smasher on 2nd try at just lvl 35 with sucky cyberware, and I'd say Adam Smasher is one of the hardest bosses in the game. This thing took me 5 tries. My advice -- when you get out of car, you get blades. Forget the blades, get back to pistol, find cover and be very careful as they'll shred you very quickly. Be careful with skulls and netrunners. First time I got killed by a runner.
3. After finally doing this, I go to the ""wounded scav"" and... nothing happens. It's bugged again. Trust me, I tried everything and I don't think I did anything unusual to cause it.

The characters introduced are likable, which is far more than I can say for quite a few of the characters in the base game. There were decisions given to the player that were hard to make. The game, through these decisions, makes you ask what it is that is important to you. Is it ideals, loyalty, freedom, what aspect of life do you value? And who will suffer for your decision to follow these ideals? It is an excellent narrative with an amazing musical score, great story and wonderful writing, and I cannot recommend it enough.

The dlc is its own thing pretty much with an extra ending of its own, which has the added benefit of skipping the remainder of the core vidya.

Now, onto the good things: the script, the pacing, the dialogues, the execution of a properly polished thriller. The DLC adds some extra missions for old fixers. Fetch quests aside, the quest are good too, adding depth and nuance to the NPCs. Though the most important is the selection of end-game choices you're presented with. Between wetwork, dubious loyalties and complex motivations of dramatis personaes, someone did their homework on intelligence services so a lot of it offers a very authentic experience. A lot of times you leave feeling dirty - because that is the nature of the work. My only criticism is you couldn't off Meyers (it'd be tons of fun, I think), but otherwise it's next to excellent. Johnny's dialogue at the end of the lunar escape was a rare gem, diverging from his usual abrasive rants. Meeting Mr Hands in person was somewhat of a letdown, but more gigs from the sphinxian villain was welcome.

It's difficult to believe the DLC was produced by the same studio as the cliché and filth-filled dumpster fire that is the core game. The setting remains as disgusting as ever, with humanity locked in a dull and primitive state of neo-feudal corporate overlords or communes of plain-roaming barbarians, but Phantom Liberty redeems the price tag. If you find a way to skip to the DLC and just play the extra, do it: it is a real treat for any lovers of a spy drama - something Deux Ex tried and failed to do.

Imagine if James Bond, Keanu Reeves, and Idris Elba decided to throw a party in Night City, and you get to clean up the mess. That’s Phantom Liberty for you.

The expansion kicks off with the President of the New United States crash-landing in Dogtown. Yes, you read that right. Apparently, Air Force One now comes with a “crash here for plot development” button. You’re hired to rescue her, but not before you navigate through a maze of cybernetic baddies, morally ambiguous choices, and enough plot twists to make a pretzel jealous.

Idris Elba’s character, Solomon Reed, is the secret agent we all wish we could be. He’s suave, he’s mysterious, and he probably has a better skincare routine than you. Meanwhile, Keanu Reeves returns as Johnny Silverhand, still rocking that “I hate the system” vibe but with a touch more existential dread. It’s like watching your cool uncle go through a mid-life crisis, but with more explosions.

Dogtown itself is a marvel. It’s like someone took all the worst parts of a dystopian future and decided to make it a tourist attraction. The local wildlife includes cyber-enhanced gangsters and vending machines that might just try to sell you a grenade. But hey, at least the street food is to die for—literally.

The gameplay is a rollercoaster of emotions. One moment you’re making life-or-death decisions, the next you’re wondering why your character’s pants have suddenly disappeared. It’s all part of the Cyberpunk experience, folks. Embrace the chaos.

In conclusion, Phantom Liberty is the perfect blend of high-stakes drama, cybernetic mayhem, and unintentional comedy. It’s like a soap opera set in a dystopian future, and honestly, we wouldn’t have it any other way. So, grab your cyberdeck, put on your best trench coat, and dive into the madness. Just watch out for those vending machines.",True,english

The game immerses you in a way that few can, combining its gripping story, breathtaking visuals, and impeccable soundtrack to pull you into the dystopian Night City. There were countless times where I would just stop to look around and take in the gorgeous views.

I found the blend of FPS and RPG elements to be very fun and engaging. Building up V's strength throughout the game was particularly satisfying for me, particularly in how it can interplay with the narrative, even if on the smaller side. Difficulty wise I thought it was pretty balanced overall. It does get on the easier side of things from mid to late game but I don't mind that at all. The game is limited to first person, which I didn't mind after awhile. It's an FPS after all. 
Overall, I loved the high octane, high stakes approach it takes to its combat.

I did not play this game when it first launched, so I have no idea what issues from release still remain. I can however report on the problems I did find regularly:
- Poor LOD Rendering
There were many times, particularly after installing the Phantom Liberty DLC, where the game's engine struggled a lot with loading LODs properly. I mainly noticed it with the NPCs and vehicles, especially when driving, where they would load at very low detail until you're like a few steps away. Rarely when driving, the road can just unload for some reason and become invisible for a couple seconds, which can really screw with you. This is pretty uncommon though.
- Low Traffic Density While Driving
When you're not driving around the city, the traffic is pretty normal. However, once you start going at high speeds on the road, traffic seems to diminish significantly. This does create an uncanny result considering its supposed to be a mega city. It seems the game does this to further save on resources, but it is still somewhat distracting how little traffic there can be.
- Vehicle Summoning
The game allows you to call your vehicle, and it will drive itself to you. Even to this day, the menu for this still says the feature is in beta. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any plans to properly finish it. Now, I bring this up because a lot of the time, the place that it chooses to spawn your car is..not great. Sometimes it will spawn on another road that's like a block away, and other times it spawns it in other vehicles. But on occasion, the car may straight up spawn in the air, where you can watch it gracefully tumble all the way to the ground. Other than traditional fast travel, cars and motorcycles are the de facto way to get around Night City, so a feature like this should probably have had more time in the oven.

Despite those recurring issues I had, they are nowhere near game breaking. They only hurt the already amazing immersion a bit. I did not really experience any crashes before installing mods, so those issues seem to be gone. In all, I definitely think the game is in a good place now. If you were thinking about getting Cyberpunk for yourself, I highly recommend it.",True,english

All the RPG elements you'd expect, fully voiced, great post-release maintenance/commitment and in a truly interesting non-fanstasy setting.

And best of all, the game very moddable with a vibrant, engaged, and productive mod community.

Only disappointing aspect was that it has no 3rd person. You cannot see the character of the story, you cannot see their cool moves and action. Rather it's like you, the player at the computer, is there rather than the character of the story. And it wasn't immediately apparent how this weakens the whole experience.

But other than that there are only two minor points of weakness, both addressable in the mature product:
1. Boss fights assume certain style of play--the dev's preference. This is solvable by mods.
2. CDPR having their favorite story ending and putting weak effort into other endings because you should have thought like the devs and writers to get the best endgame experience [see Witcher 3]. This is solvable by research and then playing the fleshed out single ending CDPR envisioned.

Everything else is top notch, engaging, and fun. Has all the RPG elements you'd expect and good quests, decent story lines. DLC is lacking, but they did release one at least--it's also very decent; almost more interesting than the main storyline [again, see Witcher 3].

The World of Cyberpunk 2077 is a dark and gritty one. A dystopian but but also real future where you're either rich or barely surviving. but what makes this game beautiful is, despite it all, you keep fighting for a better life, never fully loosing hope even at your lowest of lows. the game shows this with not only your character but also the supporting cast. Characters who often seem hard and tuff like the city has forced them to be opening up to you and being vurnurable to you as you get to know them. Judy, Panam, heck even Johnny Silverhand. all characters who I will remember and cherish.

Now as to the gameplay when this game first came out it was, and I pardon my language, Dogshit... But ever since the 2.0 update they overhauled everything and somehow did a complete 180! With the gunplay going from feeling unimpactful and bland to OOMPHY in the best way possible and then the upgrade system acually feeling worth it with new abilities and customization to make truly unique and fun builds all of which are viable! I personaly love fully upgrading reflexes allowing me to dash and dodge around both on ground and mid-air for some really fun almost bullethell like movement or going for a more stealth build allowing you to quickly take out enemy bases and finish gigs with a quick swipe reall assassin style! just a few of the many ways to play the game and I can practically garantee that there is a playstyle for you! So much fun.

The music is also amazing and somethign I wanna highlight as a producer myself. It really perfected what Cyberpunk should sound like. It's drone like nature with these elements of punk music really fusing together in such a unique way! It just has this tensity to it that just feels suspenseful. Then there's the action music which I swear I would be so much stealthier if it didn't go as hard as it goes cuz DAMN it makes me pumped! It's so intense and adrenaline filled and fits so well to every senario! truly spectacular.
but the best tracks in the game for me are the more quiet ones. the ones that play in somber or joyful moments. the themes of the characters you meet. Johnnys theme using a cello/violin making it sound like a guitar somehow is just beautiful and really shows another side of johnny in a way. and leidmotives of ""never fade away"" (a song by Johnnys band) playing at just the right times making it almost a theme of sorts for the events that it plays in. I dunno It just adds so much to the imersion and I can't get enough of it.

And don't even get me started on the DLC. Phantom Liberty is one of the best expansions I have ever played. The district of Dogtown is dense and full of fun activities to do, but once again the highlights are the characters. Somehow they're even deeper than before, feeling like acual people who all have unique motives and personalities that when it came time to choose I couldn't decide cuz I cared so much for all of them. I wanted the best for all of them but due to the nature of the story (which i won't spoil) I could'nt and it was heartbreaking, but it also felt beautiful in a way. Just absolutly phenomenal story telling and a story I will never forget.

In the end I would personally highly recommend this game. It's a game I always come back to replay, a world that I can't get enough of and one of those games that gave me something I'll keep for the rest of my life. It might take some time to get into but trust me once ur in it will be an experience you will never forget. an experience that, despite it's dark nature, made me feel hope. A thing of beauty for sure.

and a thing of beauty will never fade away...
Keep fighting",True,english

The main story is staged in Night City, an open-world sandbox with a mix of neo-noir and ganster movie characters and narratives. While the DLC's is significantly smaller in scope, it's a tight, well written spy thriller that keeps some of the same beats (the heist elements) but remains fresh with new stakes and an interesting cast.
The RPG is well implemented: in addition to ""cyberware"" -interchangeable parts that influence your controls, movements patterns, weapon affinity and some gameplay interactions, you have 3 main variables that make for very deep character building: Attributes, Perks and Skills.
You have 5 main Attributes- each Attributes will have its own ""Perk"" tree. Raising an Attribute (up to a max of 20) will unlock more (and better) Perks. Attributes mostly have an influence on weapon proficiency and some interactions, but will also impact how you approach certain missions. Will you break the door? Can you hack the door? Can you stay hidden or will you ram through? The 3D environment of Night City helps you tackle situations with a wide variety of possible solutions.
While the ""Attributes"" can only be reset once per game, the Perks can be refunded and distributed again as many times as you wish outside combat, encouraging experimentation. You can see which weapons work best for you, how your perks interact with each other and your cybernetic implants.
The Skills progress naturally- anytime you perform an action, take down an enemy with a certain weapon, pass a dialogue or Attribute check- the related Skill will increase. Up to a max of 50, every 5 levels you will unlock a permanent boost.

I think the main downside to the game is how long it is- not all missions are created equal and sometimes it's a drag or a bit of a bore, but those moments are few and sandwiched between thrilling combat sequence. Didn't particularly care for the DB elements either.

Overall 9/10, the few narrative lapses or repetitive nature of some missions didn't spoil my fun enough to bring the score lower than that. I would just add that the soundtrack is a constant banger and is very serviceable to the story.",True,english

EA FC 25 has become much more than just a football simulation game—it’s an obsession for many, almost to the point of addiction. The game’s allure lies not only in its realistic gameplay but in the psychological hooks embedded within its most popular mode, Ultimate Team. Here, players build their dream squads by purchasing and opening virtual packs, hoping to land high-rated players. The randomness of the pack openings, combined with the constant updates of new content and challenges, can feel like a never-ending cycle, which easily mirrors the addictive behaviors seen in gambling. Spending real money on virtual packs in EA FC 25 often feels like buying lottery tickets, with the dopamine rush from landing a rare player driving players to keep spending, hoping for better results next time. This practice has been widely criticized for promoting gambling habits, particularly among younger players, who might not fully grasp the financial consequences.

Personally, EA FC 25 triggers a unique frustration. Despite investing hours into perfecting skills, tweaking formations, and optimizing my Ultimate Team, the game often feels unfair. Matches can be decided by tiny, sometimes random moments—an AI glitch, a poor refereeing decision, or a lucky bounce—leaving me feeling powerless. What makes it worse is when the players you worked so hard (or spent so much) to acquire seem to underperform, leading to pure rage. The gameplay mechanics sometimes feel deliberately designed to push you into spending more, as if the better players you need to succeed are always just out of reach, unless you're willing to pay. This cycle of frustration, combined with the temptation of opening ""just one more pack,"" turns what should be a fun experience into something more stressful and, at times, toxic. The game manages to tap into that part of your brain that makes you feel like you’re on the verge of a breakthrough, but in reality, it’s pulling you deeper into the grind, causing more frustration and emotional investment than it should.",False,english

I didn't play the first one, but heard much about it. So I'm not comparing it to anything, but to me this game is a masterclass in immersion and natural as well as guided storytelling. The mechanics are great and feel different from other games. It's original. The game doesn't hold your hand, the prologue serves as a tutorial, but doesn't feel like a tutorial: You're immediately fighting for survival, but the game never feels unfair. Here and there I wished the consequences of my actions were clearer, but you can always reload, and I suggest making multiple saves. I never got soft locked, but I'm sure you can.

You explore the world as you explore mechanics and the story unfolds. The story feels very authentically interlinked with what you do. When factions were mad at me, they had good reason to, and they all have reasonable stances, that just happen to conflict very often. Moral choices are nuanced.

You will be managing and balancing dozens of things at the same time, have to make sacrifices, sometimes heavy ones, but you always have clear and realistic short and long-term goals. Some self-imposed, some from the game's plot, and some just to keep your people alive and if possible, happy. For a city management game it's extremely exciting. Oftentimes I barely scraped by.

Other developers can learn from this. How to trust your audience: show them the basic with more show than tell, then throw them into the cold water and let them figure it out.

Special shout out to the the graphics and sound design. It's actually a very pretty game and I wish I could zoom in more (the zoom-in on generators doesn't do it for me).

They really improved it."" What the devs did with Frostpunk 2 is revamp the game to be almost a new game. 

You feel the constant pressure of your choices. Everything is on the brink of collapse as you try to balance the politics, failing machinery, and ever encroaching cold with resources that are few and far and between. This truly feels like a ""survival, post-apocalyptic setting"". You desperately need more food, you finally find some frozen food stores under the ice. So you go to build an extraction district to try and pull the resources out. Some of the workforce mining the coal out of the ice died from starvation or the frost. Now you do not have enough workers. So you pull from another area. Some of the children start to go feral as the city starts to descend into anarchy. The coal mine is not producing coal as it dries up, so your generator holding the cold barely at bay is running out of fuel now.  You make a deal with a colony for some of their oil to keep the heat on for a little longer. In doing so, one of the rising factions in the city begins to oppose you because they do not like the deal you made. 

Its a constant struggle of back and forth that makes you feel you are really on the precipice of extinction and about to go over. 
Game play is outstanding. Graphics and audio are great. Some audio sound bite loops (such as when you click on one of the factions) can get old fast. Minor nitpicking aside, this game is absolutely fantastic. No you do not need to buy the first game at all. This is well worth the 45 bucks to a somewhat small studio for game play that is infinitely better than any of the sludge the ""AAA"" studios will ever produce.",True,english

If there was a neutral rating I would give it. There is a good core of the game here, keeping much of the spirit of the first game.There is a good core of the game here, keeping much of the spirit of the first game.

Pros 
1 - Game looks great. Good atmosphere and art on the menus. Colors and well done to lean into the overall dystopia steam punk vibe. 

2 - More of a natural society progression. You don't just get to choose what society you'll be with a simple choice. Your laws, the factions you favor and your choices in events grow your society. This leads to tech and law unlocks. Makes for a fun RP experience and something refreshing to see in a city builder.

3 - Most of the core mechanics of the first game are intact, so resources and heat management especially are still very much the priority.  

4 - Game still has a great soundtrack and atmosphere all around.

Neutral 

1 -  It's on a larger scale than the first game so you don't build individual buildings, you just build districts. Your ascetic control of your colony is basically non-existent. For me this is irksome, but this really comes down to a personal preference. I miss being able to craft my colony to look a certain way. But this is purely an ascetic issue and I can't knock the game for it. 

Cons 

1 - This game should have an early access tag. It has several small bugs that can really just kill your run. You'll spend some amount of time online trying to figure out what happened until you realize it's a bug.
                - Example - First scenario in new london, you establish a colony for oil. My progress just stopped even with ample frost teams. I paused all other outpots to get more frost teams, that did not restart progress. When I sent people to establish the colony, it reduce the number of works in all my buildings in new london. This caused me to have less frost teams. Even after increasing worker count, my colony would not progress in building. Had to reload. Seems like a minor bug, but annoying because if you don't catch it right away it can kill your run.


2 - QoL is poor. Resource management is an integral part of this game. Everything is a slider when it comes to resources, being workers or raw materials. Some you can get precise numbers on because the slider also has small button allowing 1 quantity changes. Others do not have this option, because reasons. So you sometimes have exact control over how many workers are somewhere, or how many resources you send/receive. Other times you just get to throw a handful of workers at a new colony and hope it's close enough to the number you want. Also you can't scroll with arrow key, or middle mouse with the sliders either. Just click and hold. You also can't cancel buildings in progress, and if you lay a building down wrong have to just deal with it later. You also while planning to build, can only cancel in sequential order. Can't click on a tile to cancel just one and build somewhere else. Minor issue but again, just more lifting for the user for seemingly no reason. 

3 - UI is bad, like all form over function bad. You can hotkey to most important things, which is fine. You can also hover over your resources and most of the numbers up top to see a better breakdown. But the idea to have the 5 categories hang below your top UI not really be intractable at all is baffling to me. The worse they get, the longer the tail they get, which can end up cluttering the top of your screen. You also get zero information about them. Some are derived stats, some are all ready covered in your resource needs. They feel redundant and don't serve much purpose beyond the look. You also cannot short cut most actions in a district. It has an empty building slot? Well can't click on the building slot to do anything. Have to exit looking at the district, go to your buildings build menu which is different from your district build menu, find the right sub category for the building you want, then select it. Seems like a minor gripe but like...you can't build any of the buildings outside of their specific district type besides heat ones. Why do they need their own menu, why can they not be done from the district menu? They're upgrades, not independent items. Game becomes more dependent on pause with small things like this. 

4 - Game is gonna chug after you set up some colonies and managing more than one city. Needs some performance optimization.",False,english

Overall it emphasizes a macro approach, with the overall scale of ""The City"" and its inhabitants dialed all the way up. The population count is higher, there are more resource/types, you can create and maintain more than one city/settlement during a run, and the faction system is dynamic. I do miss the small scale of Frostpunk 1 at times. Starting off with a handful of settlers and watching them trudge throw snow and ice, some freezing to death, in a desperate effort to collect enough coal and other resources to survive. Frostpunk 2s larger scale results in not experiencing or witnessing your citizens in the same way, but overall there can be no doubt Frostpunk 2 will be a successful sequel.",True,english

The change in scale from the original, as others have pointed out, makes things a bit less impactful. I find myself going, ""well, that's the cost of doing business"" way too much.
However, my biggest issue is that, despite the delayed release, the game really could've benefited from another few months in the oven to polish off some of the more obvious bugs. For example, I've encountered a few weird UI glitches. That's to say nothing of the day-1 patch ""temporary fix"" for what is a pretty jarring audio crackling issue in big cities. It's not a good look to release it like this.

Please, developers, and I mean all game developers, not just 11-Bit Studios: Polish off your games. People will forgive less obvious bugs, but when you release a game with glaring issues that *had* to have been apparent prior to release, it's really bad form. Day-1 patches for these kinds of issues don't really mitigate the optics, in my book. Day-1 patches say to me, ""we know the game isn't finished, but we're releasing it anyway.""

In conclusion, this is a tentative ""not recommended"" from me, purely on the grounds of it being released without solving the aforementioned obvious bugs. I'm confident these issues will be fixed soon, but the game being released in this state leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",False,english

Yes there is the mode utopia, but this one feels like you doing the campaign all over again. There is no difference. The game feels boring after 29 hours of playtime. Once you get the captain role enforced. There is no more event.

It does feel like a natural progression from Frostpunk 1, in terms of scale. In both games, resource management is important and have far-reaching consequences if you do not manage it well. I do agree with some reviews that in Frostpunk 2, you don't feel as attached to the individuals when compared to Frostpunk 1. People, at least to a degree, are just numbers. But I did enjoy the statements from individual characters in the game in general. However, when I finished the main story, I wouldn't help but wonder if I did my best, or whether I did the right thing. All I could say was an attempt was made. I would argue there was an emotional attachment involved in Frostpunk 2, but not to the individual. Rather, I felt more attached to the city itself. Achieving that isn't easy and I do applaud 11-Bit Studios for taking a risk here. The game did do a good job at making things feel desperate near the end but I do admit, the music wasn't as noticeable for some reason.

I find they often ruin great games.  I eventually gave in and bought this during a trial period and really enjoyed it, so much so that I bought it, despite my grumblings against it.  Since then I've enjoyed it, despite the battle pass, which only has cosmetic rewards.  I still don't love the idea of a battle pass but the fact that the battle pass is purely cosmetic helps water it down for me.  Another thing that helps greatly is that the free tier of armor looks really amazing.  They didn't skimp on armor cosmetics to try and guide people towards buying cosmetics, which is a big plus and actually the only reason I would recommend the game.  As far as game play goes, it's been really fun.  End game is a little complicated and to get anywhere you have to follow someone else's build but that's pretty standard for RPGs these days.",True,english

amazing.
a few bad bosses, nothing a avg person cant manage.
needs to work on the progression of the game, I feel like I cant wear a armor set that's actually cool because you unlock a new craft every 1-2 hours and most of the time they are way better than what ever armor set you crafted before that. 
the combat is great and I feel like there is a lot of build variety especially when you get some of the mythical staffs. 
the game is long and great. ~50 hours for me to beat 6 chapters, and get the true ending so :)...

Everyone complained about how this sucked, and we missed the good old days of campaign, multi player PvE, and PvP. No monetizing the crap out of us, and no political agendas to be found.

Luckily I have friends who let me play on their consoles and experience the game.

The Story is not over bearing with characters speech that adds nothing to the game. A casual gamer looking for a couch co-op game can jump into the story and understand the general idea of what is happening and enjoy the story. Furthermore, someone who is decently well versed in the grim dark universe will appreciate characters building upon the setting and making the player feel as if they are apart of a multi planet defense against heretical xenos.

The game play is not exactly casual, offering a challenge to players that can be overcome with most any game play style chosen. The game brings back a hack and slash, co-op gamer missed by many of gamers. The combat is executed in a cinematic world built with care to detail, with brutal combat and satisfying finishers.

After finally folding and purchasing the base game at a discount, I quickly grew to love the combat system, methods of gaining power, and especially the story the game told. The most important part of any game to me is the story, followed by the combat mechanics, then the graphics. Cyberpunk smashed all my expectations so much so that I purchased Phantom Liberty at full price when I was halfway through the game, solely because I knew I wanted more content before the end of the game. I'm very glad I did. The DLC has been wonderful, and without spoiling it, I would rate it 2 tiers above the base game (7/10 - base, 9/10 DlC, for an average of 8/10). Note that 5/10 simply means ""average"" and reasonable for the experience/price. I fully recommend the DLC if you enjoyed the base game.",True,english

1. For some reason, when the chase starts and you get hit by a car and continue driving, we did not continue. Our car got pushed to the gate and didn't move. I had to restart.
2. Then when you start fighting scavs, it's needlessly hard. It's my 2nd playthrough, on hard difficulty. On hard, I killed Adam Smasher on 2nd try at just lvl 35 with sucky cyberware, and I'd say Adam Smasher is one of the hardest bosses in the game. This thing took me 5 tries. My advice -- when you get out of car, you get blades. Forget the blades, get back to pistol, find cover and be very careful as they'll shred you very quickly. Be careful with skulls and netrunners. First time I got killed by a runner.
3. After finally doing this, I go to the ""wounded scav"" and... nothing happens. It's bugged again. Trust me, I tried everything and I don't think I did anything unusual to cause it. 

At this point I just lost it. Come on, The DLC had been out for a year now, and the base game is 4 years old at this point. I understand that making games of this scale is hard. Even after 4 years, in the base game content, I still encounter some small bugs but I'm like ""okay, no biggie"". But this is just not acceptable quality.",False,english

The game, through these decisions, makes you ask what it is that is important to you. Is it ideals, loyalty, freedom, what aspect of life do you value?

The dlc is its own thing pretty much with an extra ending of its own, which has the added benefit of skipping the remainder of the core vidya.

Now, onto the good things: the script, the pacing, the dialogues, the execution of a properly polished thriller. The DLC adds some extra missions for old fixers. Fetch quests aside, the quest are good too, adding depth and nuance to the NPCs. Though the most important is the selection of end-game choices you're presented with. Between wetwork, dubious loyalties and complex motivations of dramatis personaes, someone did their homework on intelligence services so a lot of it offers a very authentic experience. A lot of times you leave feeling dirty - because that is the nature of the work. My only criticism is you couldn't off Meyers (it'd be tons of fun, I think), but otherwise it's next to excellent. Johnny's dialogue at the end of the lunar escape was a rare gem, diverging from his usual abrasive rants. Meeting Mr Hands in person was somewhat of a letdown, but more gigs from the sphinxian villain was welcome.

It's difficult to believe the DLC was produced by the same studio as the cliché and filth-filled dumpster fire that is the core game. The setting remains as disgusting as ever, with humanity locked in a dull and primitive state of neo-feudal corporate overlords or communes of plain-roaming barbarians, but Phantom Liberty redeems the price tag. If you find a way to skip to the DLC and just play the extra, do it: it is a real treat for any lovers of a spy drama - something Deux Ex tried and failed to do.

Imagine if James Bond, Keanu Reeves, and Idris Elba decided to throw a party in Night City, and you get to clean up the mess. That’s Phantom Liberty for you.

The expansion kicks off with the President of the New United States crash-landing in Dogtown. Yes, you read that right. Apparently, Air Force One now comes with a “crash here for plot development” button. You’re hired to rescue her, but not before you navigate through a maze of cybernetic baddies, morally ambiguous choices, and enough plot twists to make a pretzel jealous.

Idris Elba’s character, Solomon Reed, is the secret agent we all wish we could be. He’s suave, he’s mysterious, and he probably has a better skincare routine than you. Meanwhile, Keanu Reeves returns as Johnny Silverhand, still rocking that “I hate the system” vibe but with a touch more existential dread. It’s like watching your cool uncle go through a mid-life crisis, but with more explosions.

Dogtown itself is a marvel. It’s like someone took all the worst parts of a dystopian future and decided to make it a tourist attraction. The local wildlife includes cyber-enhanced gangsters and vending machines that might just try to sell you a grenade. But hey, at least the street food is to die for—literally.

The gameplay is a rollercoaster of emotions. One moment you’re making life-or-death decisions, the next you’re wondering why your character’s pants have suddenly disappeared. It’s all part of the Cyberpunk experience, folks. Embrace the chaos.

In conclusion, Phantom Liberty is the perfect blend of high-stakes drama, cybernetic mayhem, and unintentional comedy. It’s like a soap opera set in a dystopian future, and honestly, we wouldn’t have it any other way. So, grab your cyberdeck, put on your best trench coat, and dive into the madness. Just watch out for those vending machines.",True,english

The game immerses you in a way that few can, combining its gripping story, breathtaking visuals, and impeccable soundtrack to pull you into the dystopian Night City. There were countless times where I would just stop to look around and take in the gorgeous views.

I found the blend of FPS and RPG elements to be very fun and engaging. Building up V's strength throughout the game was particularly satisfying for me, particularly in how it can interplay with the narrative, even if on the smaller side. Difficulty wise I thought it was pretty balanced overall. It does get on the easier side of things from mid to late game but I don't mind that at all. The game is limited to first person, which I didn't mind after awhile. It's an FPS after all. 
Overall, I loved the high octane, high stakes approach it takes to its combat.

I did not play this game when it first launched, so I have no idea what issues from release still remain. I can however report on the problems I did find regularly:
- Poor LOD Rendering
There were many times, particularly after installing the Phantom Liberty DLC, where the game's engine struggled a lot with loading LODs properly. I mainly noticed it with the NPCs and vehicles, especially when driving, where they would load at very low detail until you're like a few steps away. Rarely when driving, the road can just unload for some reason and become invisible for a couple seconds, which can really screw with you. This is pretty uncommon though.
- Low Traffic Density While Driving
When you're not driving around the city, the traffic is pretty normal. However, once you start going at high speeds on the road, traffic seems to diminish significantly. This does create an uncanny result considering its supposed to be a mega city. It seems the game does this to further save on resources, but it is still somewhat distracting how little traffic there can be.
- Vehicle Summoning
The game allows you to call your vehicle, and it will drive itself to you. Even to this day, the menu for this still says the feature is in beta. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any plans to properly finish it. Now, I bring this up because a lot of the time, the place that it chooses to spawn your car is..not great. Sometimes it will spawn on another road that's like a block away, and other times it spawns it in other vehicles. But on occasion, the car may straight up spawn in the air, where you can watch it gracefully tumble all the way to the ground. Other than traditional fast travel, cars and motorcycles are the de facto way to get around Night City, so a feature like this should probably have had more time in the oven.

Despite those recurring issues I had, they are nowhere near game breaking. They only hurt the already amazing immersion a bit. I did not really experience any crashes before installing mods, so those issues seem to be gone. In all, I definitely think the game is in a good place now. If you were thinking about getting Cyberpunk for yourself, I highly recommend it.",True,english

All the RPG elements you'd expect, fully voiced, great post-release maintenance/commitment and in a truly interesting non-fanstasy setting. The mechanics don't really mirror Cyberpunk 2020 or Cyberpunk: RED TTRPGs; while unfortunate, the mechanics in this game are solid.

And best of all, the game very moddable with a vibrant, engaged, and productive mod community.

Only disappointing aspect was that it has no 3rd person. You cannot see the character of the story, you cannot see their cool moves and action. Rather it's like you, the player at the computer, is there rather than the character of the story. And it wasn't immediately apparent how this weakens the whole experience.

But other than that there are only two minor points of weakness, both addressable in the mature product:
1. Boss fights assume certain style of play--the dev's preference. This is solvable by mods.
2. CDPR having their favorite story ending and putting weak effort into other endings because you should have thought like the devs and writers to get the best endgame experience [see Witcher 3]. This is solvable by research and then playing the fleshed out single ending CDPR envisioned.

Everything else is top notch, engaging, and fun. Has all the RPG elements you'd expect and good quests, decent story lines. DLC is lacking, but they did release one at least--it's also very decent; almost more interesting than the main storyline [again, see Witcher 3].

The World of Cyberpunk 2077 is a dark and gritty one. A dystopian but but also real future where you're either rich or barely surviving. but what makes this game beautiful is, despite it all, you keep fighting for a better life, never fully loosing hope even at your lowest of lows. the game shows this with not only your character but also the supporting cast. Characters who often seem hard and tuff like the city has forced them to be opening up to you and being vurnurable to you as you get to know them. Judy, Panam, heck even Johnny Silverhand. all characters who I will remember and cherish.

Now as to the gameplay when this game first came out it was, and I pardon my language, Dogshit... But ever since the 2.0 update they overhauled everything and somehow did a complete 180! With the gunplay going from feeling unimpactful and bland to OOMPHY in the best way possible and then the upgrade system acually feeling worth it with new abilities and customization to make truly unique and fun builds all of which are viable! I personaly love fully upgrading reflexes allowing me to dash and dodge around both on ground and mid-air for some really fun almost bullethell like movement or going for a more stealth build allowing you to quickly take out enemy bases and finish gigs with a quick swipe reall assassin style! just a few of the many ways to play the game and I can practically garantee that there is a playstyle for you! So much fun.

The music is also amazing and somethign I wanna highlight as a producer myself. It really perfected what Cyberpunk should sound like. It's drone like nature with these elements of punk music really fusing together in such a unique way! It just has this tensity to it that just feels suspenseful. Then there's the action music which I swear I would be so much stealthier if it didn't go as hard as it goes cuz DAMN it makes me pumped! It's so intense and adrenaline filled and fits so well to every senario! truly spectacular.
but the best tracks in the game for me are the more quiet ones. the ones that play in somber or joyful moments. the themes of the characters you meet. Johnnys theme using a cello/violin making it sound like a guitar somehow is just beautiful and really shows another side of johnny in a way. and leidmotives of ""never fade away"" (a song by Johnnys band) playing at just the right times making it almost a theme of sorts for the events that it plays in. I dunno It just adds so much to the imersion and I can't get enough of it.

And don't even get me started on the DLC. Phantom Liberty is one of the best expansions I have ever played. The district of Dogtown is dense and full of fun activities to do, but once again the highlights are the characters. Somehow they're even deeper than before, feeling like acual people who all have unique motives and personalities that when it came time to choose I couldn't decide cuz I cared so much for all of them. I wanted the best for all of them but due to the nature of the story (which i won't spoil) I could'nt and it was heartbreaking, but it also felt beautiful in a way. Just absolutly phenomenal story telling and a story I will never forget.

In the end I would personally highly recommend this game. It's a game I always come back to replay, a world that I can't get enough of and one of those games that gave me something I'll keep for the rest of my life. It might take some time to get into but trust me once ur in it will be an experience you will never forget. an experience that, despite it's dark nature, made me feel hope. A thing of beauty for sure.

and a thing of beauty will never fade away...
Keep fighting",True,english

The main story is staged in Night City, an open-world sandbox with a mix of neo-noir and ganster movie characters and narratives. While the DLC's is significantly smaller in scope, it's a tight, well written spy thriller that keeps some of the same beats (the heist elements) but remains fresh with new stakes and an interesting cast.
The RPG is well implemented: in addition to ""cyberware"" -interchangeable parts that influence your controls, movements patterns, weapon affinity and some gameplay interactions, you have 3 main variables that make for very deep character building: Attributes, Perks and Skills.
You have 5 main Attributes- each Attributes will have its own ""Perk"" tree. Raising an Attribute (up to a max of 20) will unlock more (and better) Perks. Attributes mostly have an influence on weapon proficiency and some interactions, but will also impact how you approach certain missions. Will you break the door? Can you hack the door? Can you stay hidden or will you ram through? The 3D environment of Night City helps you tackle situations with a wide variety of possible solutions.
While the ""Attributes"" can only be reset once per game, the Perks can be refunded and distributed again as many times as you wish outside combat, encouraging experimentation. You can see which weapons work best for you, how your perks interact with each other and your cybernetic implants.
The Skills progress naturally- anytime you perform an action, take down an enemy with a certain weapon, pass a dialogue or Attribute check- the related Skill will increase. Up to a max of 50, every 5 levels you will unlock a permanent boost.

I think the main downside to the game is how long it is- not all missions are created equal and sometimes it's a drag or a bit of a bore, but those moments are few and sandwiched between thrilling combat sequence. Didn't particularly care for the DB elements either.

Overall 9/10, the few narrative lapses or repetitive nature of some missions didn't spoil my fun enough to bring the score lower than that. I would just add that the soundtrack is a constant banger and is very serviceable to the story.",True,english

Please continue to give us fleshed out stories of classic literature with dark and cryptic twists. This way all other studios will be incentivised to up their game. 

We don't need multiplayer everything to sell games. This is testament to that. Never would I have thought that after watching JTTW in the 90s, I would be playing a AAA title featuring *sorta* the titular character in 2024. Life is beautiful when it hits.",True,english

amazing.
a few bad bosses, nothing a avg person cant manage.
needs to work on the progression of the game, I feel like I cant wear a armor set that's actually cool because you unlock a new craft every 1-2 hours and most of the time they are way better than what ever armor set you crafted before that. 
the combat is great and I feel like there is a lot of build variety especially when you get some of the mythical staffs. 
the game is long and great. ~50 hours for me to beat 6 chapters, and get the true ending so :)...

probably going to buy the dlc when ever it comes out, which is very soon actually because the base game was supposed to have like 11 chapters and most of the chapters had most of the design done",True,english

Everyone complained that something new was needed.

So then for years, game developers tried everything they could think of to change the gaming paradigm into not just something different than the classic game modes, but how to monetize the crap out of it while pushing their own political narrative and morals. Everyone complained about how this sucked, and we missed the good old days of campaign, multi player PvE, and PvP. No monetizing the crap out of us, and no political agendas to be found.

Space Marine 2 is a fantastic return to the ""good old days."" No agendas, just game lore followed. Hack and slash with a smattering of strategy. Classic game modes and game play.

My very low end computer has some trouble running the game, nonetheless I will not say that adds any negative remarks on the game; I made a poor investment for gaming. Luckily I have friends who let me play on their consoles and experience the game.

The Story is not over bearing with characters speech that adds nothing to the game. A casual gamer looking for a couch co-op game can jump into the story and understand the general idea of what is happening and enjoy the story. Furthermore, someone who is decently well versed in the grim dark universe will appreciate characters building upon the setting and making the player feel as if they are apart of a multi planet defense against heretical xenos.

The game play is not exactly casual, offering a challenge to players that can be overcome with most any game play style chosen. The game brings back a hack and slash, co-op gamer missed by many of gamers. The combat is executed in a cinematic world built with care to detail, with brutal combat and satisfying finishers.

When [b]Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (LADIW)[/b] first trailer came out, I was really looking forward to coming back to the turn-based JRPG gameplay that the game was going for. I was really excited to what the game improved on with [b]Y7[/b] and what new features that the game had in store for it. With that said, this review will also be a bit hard for me to cover in certain aspects, as I don’t want to spoil anything on the game.

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*]A very interestingly crafted story with fun characters
[*]Fun turn-based gameplay
[*]Unique jobs that can give you a variety of moves
[*]Lots of side content to do in the game
[*]Fantastic soundtrack that is nice to listen to
[*]Beautiful graphics that make the areas feel alive
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]The story loses some of its charm near the end
[*]New Game+ and other difficulties locked behind a DLC
[/list]

[h1]Story[/h1]
[b]Ichiban Kasuga[/b] was working at an average job until he one day gets let go from his and cancled by a [b[Vtuber[/b] on in one day. This is due to a callout video made by a [b]Vtuber[/b] named [b]Hisoka Tatara[/b] and because of this [b]Kasuga[/b], with his two friends, [b]Nanba and Adachi[/b], decide to go to the [b]Seiryu clan[/b], to find answers. Along their way, they meet ex-yakuza members and meet [b]Jo Sawashiro[/b], who then tells [b]Kasuga[/b] to go to [b]Hawill[/b] and find his mother. Although there is a lot more going on then one may seem.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3333939084
The story for [b]LADIW[/b] is pretty good, I really loved the new characters and the returning ones were also nice. I honesty think even telling one of my favorite characters is spoiling the story too much, besides [b]Tomizawa[/b], who is a cab driver and was just a cool character. The story has that classic crime drama that the series is known for.

However, the story does lose some of its charm near the end of the game, as it falls off a tad bit although this is only a minor issue that I noticed. Everything else with the story is great but near the end, it kind of just goes away, although they do leave off with an interesting note for it’s next game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[b]LADIW’s[/b] gameplay mainly remains the same from the previous entry but there are some changes that I really loved that the game added. Besides [b]Kasuga[/b], everyone will now pick up objects to attack people if they are near them. So if you ever wanted to see [b]Nanba[/b] throw a bike at someone, well now you can. You can also use MP to cast special moves to deal more damage, buff/debuff someone, or heal. Overall, the gameplay is very fun and your characters can learn lots of moves to help them in combat.

During combat, you can also time the enemy's attacks so you can block them to do less damage. One of the newest things to combat for enemies is that they can be in a guard state, when they are in this, they will take reduced damage. To get them out of the guard state mainly, you have to use a grab attack, in which they will be taken out of that state. Your teammates also have a radius on their attacks, they can attack any enemy at any range but if they stay in the radius, they will do extra damage on that attack.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3333941765
Jobs are back as well and there are some unique ones that are with each party member. This time around, all the jobs in this game are very good and there isn’t one that is bad necessarily. However, there are some jobs that are ok for the most part but aren’t bad, it is up to personal preference but I never really came across a bad job in this game for any character. Especially [b]Joongi Han or Seonhee[/b] where their main jobs were just straight up broken.

If you want to switch jobs but keep a certain move, you can do it with a move transfer feature that the game has. Which is very useful to create the ultimate character with the best job with some of the best moves in another job. Although you can only do up to five moves in total completely. So make sure you have the moves that you want to use and keep note of them so you can make the most of them.

There is a ton of side content that the game has in it and some very interesting ones at that. The first one I would like to bring up is [b]Sujimon[/b], which is this game's version of [b]Pokemon[/b], where you battle [b]Sujimon[/b] trainers and challenge gym leaders. Then there is [b]Dondoko Island[/b], where you manage a hotel resort, it’s like [b]Animal Crossing[/b] to an extent. So as you can see, You have three games in one, [b]Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, Pokemon, and Animal Crossing[/b]. There is a lot to the gameplay that I have not explained but I can’t fit it all into this review, I do talk a little more about this game in my video on it (will be out soon, ran into some problems}. I also rated all the [b]Yakuza[/b] games that I have played so if you are interested in that, keep an eye out for it.

Although despite having all of this great stuff in this game, [b]Infinite Wealth[/b] has one glaring issue with its gameplay or the game as a whole. New Game+, is locked behind a DLC and so is hard mode, in other words, you only have access to one difficulty for the game. The game isn’t that hard either but the fact that a basic game feature is locked behind a DLC just proves [b]Sega’s[/b] greed.

[h1]Graphics, Performance and Soundtrack[/h1]
The graphics for this game are beautiful and I loved how the world that you are in is detailed, each area felt real and it’s like I was in its world. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM, I had no issues while I was playing and I was able to play it just fine, on medium settings.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3333942218
The soundtrack for this game is just fantastic and it even rivals Y0’s soundtrack, my favorite songs in the game are [b]Camouflage, Barracuda, and Giftiger Füllhalter[/b]. These songs just sound so damn nice to listen to and I highly recommend you check them out when given the chance.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
[b]Infinite Wealth[/b] is one of the best games that I have played this year and I am glad I was able to experience it in all its glory. I recommend this game to all [b]Yakuza[/b] fans, especially for those who enjoyed [b]Y7[/b]. You will have a great time with this game and the side content will make sure you are hooked and are playing the game for hours on end.

Three words that fit this game perfectly. There is nothing more infuriating then trying to get on with a game's story just to be thrown into a forced animal crossing bootleg tutorial. The game's story (when it isn't extremely predictable or being hindered by endless filler) is pretty good and I want to see more of it, so it's a shame that you have to trudge through sneaking through crowded streets of enemies for an hour to get to it. It got to the point where I just had to go on WeMod and turn on stealth mode. This game could have been great, but since the seventh entry they've really dropped the ball with the franchise.
Also Ichiban is not a good character. Having a character obnoxiously looking for the good in horrid people doesn't make him a good guy, it makes him stupid, and no matter how hard you try to push this ""him and Kiryu are so alike"" point it will never make it true. ",False,english

The Hawaii map is incredible!

At a whopping 127 hours by Steam playtime, Infinite Wealth is now the longest game I've ever played by a huge margin. It took me nearly 40 hours longer than its predecessor, and over 30 hours longer than it took to earn a platinum trophy in Persona 5 Royal. Whatever else you want to say about this game, you can't say that you're not getting your money's worth. The bigger question is whether this incredible level of time investment is worth it. Although this is in many ways a great game, it's harder than I'd like to say that it was 127 hours well spent. 

Let's start with the good news. The main story is well done, and you could probably get through it in a relatively normal amount of time for a JRPG if you're focused on it. It has some fun fights and a lot of callbacks that I'm sure are exciting and rewarding content if you've played Yakuza 0-6. The new characters are deeply integrated into the plot and have satisfying arcs. Honolulu is a fun city to explore and feels as different from Ijincho as you'd expect.

A lot of the other things that were good in the last game remain fun. The battle system is still great, and made more so by new jobs. The music is great. There are some entertaining side quests, the minigames are gloriously stupid, and so on. You'd expect at least a few things that are horribly underdeveloped in a game this long, but everything is basically fine at a minimum. 

The bad news is that while nothing truly feels incomplete, many parts of the game would have benefited from more refinement. Although the minigames are fun, there are only a handful of new ones and there's nothing as crazy as kart racing or running a public company from the last game. Most of them, like the parodies of Crazy Taxi and Pokemon Snap are solid experiences that run out of new content after 20 minutes and don't have worthwhile rewards. The highlights are supposed to be Donodoko Island and Sujimon battling, which parody Animal Crossing and Pokemon respectively, but neither of them have the depth to reach their full potential. Dondoko island boils down to spamming buildings all over your island until you get the next cutscene, and Sujimon battling is almost entirely determined by who has the best rarity Sujimon at the highest level. Since each Sujimon only has one move and all moves do pretty much the same thing with different damage totals, there's little reason to anything other than mash A and occasionally swap for type matchups. You need to complete Dondoko Island and the Sujimon league if you want to complete all the quests, but they're each long enough that you could have finished an entirely different game instead. That was one thing in the last game when the minigames were as fun as many other full games, but in this case it really didn't feel worth the time. 

Sadly, the minigames aren't the only place where you get the feeling that the devs didn't get all the time they needed. The story rushes to make sure every major character returns, but several of them clearly have no reason to be back and barely play any role other than being present. The final battles at the end of the game are well made and difficult, but the evil monologues you're treated to reveal that the villains never really had any kind of coherent plan, which makes you wonder what the point of it all was and whether there was supposed to be more content that would have tied everything together better. It's all capped off by one of the main party characters not even being present for the epilogue and instead just getting a single sentence to explain what happened. It's not quite ""and then everybody died, the end"", but it's hard to imagine an explanation other than not having time to make another epilogue cutscene. 

At the end of the day, Infinite Wealth is a great game that just tries to do too much. RGG wanted to have a sendoff for Kiryu while also telling a new story on the scale of the last game, and they really should have picked one or the other. Although they do a better job of integrating those two very disparate goals than you might expect, trying to cram all of that into a game with anything resembling a normal runtime just means that nothing gets the time it deserved. It's still a good game, but I can't help but wonder if it would have been better as two separate games that each had a single goal. If nothing else, that would have prevented the need to break the cast up into two small parties and given you more flexibility to build your battle team.

I know some fans of the Yakuza series have criticized parts of this game's story, and understandably so, but this game more than makes up for it. Hawaii as a setting for Ichiban and his pals works so well it seems like they've always been there. Every single part of the map is blooming with beautiful sights to see, and fun things to do. From the main story, to the side quests, to the many alternate game modes, this game never stops entertaining you. The story for this game is it's most divisive part, and for me it was my favorite part. I was an orphan myself, and the fact that a huge portion of Ichiban's story in this game was getting to see his birth-mother again was a beautiful thing that every adopted child wishes they could do. The scenes with Ichiban reminiscing on his family and what could have been felt like things that have gone through my head a hundred times. Kiryu's story was also somber. With our favorite dragon now having cancer, he can't fight like he used to. He learns to rely on his friends, which is a lesson everybody needs to learn eventually. The finale for both of these incredible characters fit perfectly within their themes, and it ends in an extremely satisfying way. The new characters are also fantastic. Chitose, Tomizawa, and Yamai are all realistic characters with interesting backstories and they fit right in with all of our favorites. The combat here is also a massive step-up from Yakuza 7. We now have movement options within the fights, which make planning and executing your moves that much more strategic. Add in an insane number of jobs, and you have a combat system that's fun all the way through. This game has so much to offer to so many different types of people, and that's why the Yakuza franchise is so incredible. Please play this game. You won't regret it.",True,english

The general whole is enjoyable. The difficulty is mostly enjoyable. I would only recommend it to diehard souls-like fans. It's bogged down by so much annoying or disappointing shit. Slightly randomized perfect guard times, nearly every boss has two phases, every enemy is either a tank or dies in three hits. For the challenge and subtle randomization involved in a Perfect Guard, you'd expect it to be more rewarding, but all it does is make you suffer no damage when blocking.

Although unlike Dark Souls parrying is basically required just like Sekiro except the timing is a bit harder. Although I am a Souls veteran, I struggled immensely on the first somewhat challenging boss because it was pretty much a test of how well you could parry as simply whiff punishing between his attacks did very little damage. So parrying was the only way to get big damage by breaking his posture and riposting him. Once you master that, you've ""gotten good"" at LoP. There is also the rally system from Bloodborne, which just lets you regain most of the damage taken from blocking if you attack the opponent a few times after. The overall game has the same amount of polish as FromSoftware games, though it has a surprising amount of DNA from Code Vein in the sound and visual effects, and some mechanics like sliding down ladders and interacting with more things at your home base.

The first part of this review is for the general game, the second part is the threshold where I accepted it wasn't worth continuing.

Pros:
1.  The Legion arm mechanic is pretty cool.  Essentially preset secondary equipments that can be upgraded to add new passives to them.  Examples include a staggering grapple hook, a charge up electric blast, a landmine summoner, and a a retaliatory shield.  Legion arms allow you to get a boost against harder foes that your weapon proves insufficient for.
2.  Parry mechanics.  Depending on what kind of enemy your fighting, a perfect parry will either help stagger them for a combo hit or help shatter their weapon, reducing attack variety and damage.
3.  Specters act as boss assists if you're frustrated or unable to defeat a boss.  It's a pretty big help if your too frustrated.

Cons:
1.  Underwhelming soundtrack.  The only music in the game outside of the gramophone is against bosses, and they all sound pretty similar.
2.  Finite resources.  There's only one copy of each weapon, armor, and amulet, with no way to get more.  If you sold or missed an item, it's gone forever, the entire playthrough.  Quartz, the skilltree material, can't even cover half the skilltree without running out for the rest of the playthrough.  Cranks, allowing you to tinker with weapon scaling, are also finite, discouraging experimentation.  Consumables have to be slowly grinded for until chapter 5 when you can buy them.
3.  Rushed choices.  Any time the game has you make a narrative choice, it gives you about 6 seconds before automatically selecting whatever your cursor touched last, leaving no time to think anything through.  This leads to decisions feeling incoherent and shallow.
4.  Lack of information.  The game doesn't tell you what three of your six stats even do, making the early game confusing.  Status effects only tell you what they do once they've killed you.

Last part of my review is unfairness.  Up until Elysian Boulevard, the game does quite well with dying being your fault rather than cheap shots or instant death.  Once you reach the boss there, you have your first instance of simply full on stun locking you with no escape method.  Once you trudge your way through that, you soon hit the swamp monster, with the ability to also kill you in one inescapable combo, but with the addition of being far too durable to kill with consumables and shredding your specter.  Outside of bosses, several things lead to being unfair.  Several points have enemy locations that you can't reasonably deal with, leading to barely avoidable damage.

Keep in mind that this is my first souls like, so I can't compare it well to others.  I do enjoy difficult games such as Dead Cells and Celeste, but difficult and unfair are rather different things.",False,english

This game compared to most Souls-like games has given the most care out of any games I have seen. Not many games give an equal fairness into their mechanics besides this one.

I own Elden Ring, but I never completed it because I got too lost in its open-world concept. However, this game was an amazing introduction to the genre, especially considering it comes from a smaller studio, not a massive corporation.

The story is captivating, and the game does a great job guiding you through it. The voice acting is absolutely incredible—most games have at least a bit of cringe in their dialogue, but not this one. The performances are top-notch.

Combat is really fun and rewarding. Parrying can break enemies' weapons, and you can combine different weapons and handles (I mostly used boss weapons throughout the game). I didn’t find the game overly difficult either—you can even beat some bosses with throwable items, and certain bosses allow you to summon an aid, which is super helpful.

The music is also insane. It’s one of the highlights of the game for sure. After beating it, I immediately wanted to start another playthrough, but I’ve heard that DLC and a sequel have been announced, so I’m waiting for that. When the DLC drops, I’m definitely doing another run with a new weapon setup.

If you’ve never played a Souls game, I really believe this is a great entry point into the genre. I highly recommend it!",True,english

Great story. Mostly great game. 3 of the bosses try hard to ruin it.

Given the fact that this is a game built almost entirely on parrying, it's frustrating when you can't stop a chain of actions to parry or dodge. Also any hit seems to slightly stagger P. For a split second you can't move and for just slightly longer you can't parry or dodge. Not a problem for most of the game, but for the very fast bosses chaining attacks, it's annoying you can see P not reacting to your input as another attack comes in. Yet for the most part, your attacks don't have the same effect.

There are minor issues with it such as bosses that jump very high in the air, yet the camera angle cannot look straight up. In some places it's like ledges are covered in grease. It's possible to be pinned against a wall or object by an enemy and have no way out, it's effectively a death sentence with certain enemies.

*Minor spoilers*
Most of the bosses are fun with good cut scenes.
3 of them are not fun. The King of Puppets, Laxasia and the Nameless puppet.
There is clearly a reason the achievement % drops off at each of these.
The times I beat them, it was luck of the draw of how aggressive the boss was feeling that round.

Sometimes it feels like that game goes out of it's way to kill you if you do ""too well"" and get close to killing the boss quickly in the first few rounds. You'll soon be punished with an onslaught. Yet if you just stand there and practice parrying, you don't get the same intense beating.

For the fights with the spectre, for me just using a single HP re-gen wish on it worked well to keep the boss distracted for longer. Other wishes are okay, but nowhere near as impactful as simply having two of you in the battle for longer.

Save throwing items until you have the boss down to <10% health, then use them to help finish it quick. Otherwise don't bother using them, they're effectively a limited resource before you'll have to go out farming for them. 

I beat each of the above 3 by using fable arts and throwables in those last few moments.",True,english

Lies of P sees you lead as Gepetto's puppet in a twisted, gloomy take on the folktale of Pinocchio. Waking up in an eerie train station, you soon make your way outside to the city of Krat, where a sudden trigger in the puppets causes a haunting massacre that sets the tone for the rest of the game.

     On that note, atmosphere is the name. Hotel Krat is your central hub, and it quickly evolved from being a brief trip to level up my weapons into a safe retreat where I could listen to a vibrant soundtrack in the background as I spoke with the many charismatic faces that made up this iconic location. It's not just the hub area - everything from oil-lined streets to infested cathedrals, the immense amount of detail present within the level design itself across most of the chapters is incredibly impressive. Whether it was my first playthrough or my sixth, I could not help but immerse myself in all of the intricately placed bodies & texts around the city that truly cements this game as an all-time example of how to do proper environmental storytelling within linear experiences. Neowiz and Round8 really wear the inspiration on their sleeves with the worldbuilding here and it's very well executed. (Note: it runs flawlessly for me on an upper-end rig, but even on my steam deck it is the best performing game I own. It's also very nicely balanced and well-paced. I would say I preferred the difficulty around launch, as it really heightened my enjoyment of this game in a unique way because of how challenging it was. But it's still a decent challenge and NG+ definitely brought that difficulty back.) 

     Combat is really where Lies of P hits all of its strides for me. As a fan of FromSoftware's 'soulsborne' entries for the better part of a decade, I believe Lies of P implements so many positive spins on their formula that I would recommend this over the traditional souls games to any player, regardless of experience (well... maybe play Sekiro.) For example, one of my favorite mechanics is pulse recharge, which allows you to gain one more charge to your healing consumable if you are at zero. This feature would change the entire dynamic of so many of my fights in an instant. Maybe I'm playing defensively, I've got two more heals and 60% of the boss's health left; in scenarios like this, every single time I reached zero heals, my brain would switch to aggression immediately in the hopes of regaining a charge and feel more 'comfortable.' I cannot speak to everyone's experience, but this mechanic made me a better player over time as I was PUSHED into being more active in my gameplay and subsequently rewarded with the most satisfying sound effect I've heard since the Halo CE shield recharge as a single pulse cell materializes right back into your upper belt. 

     Another great feature to the combat sandbox is the ability to assemble weapons. This is the single-most innovative design choice that Lies of P offers. Every weapon comes in two distinct parts, the blade tip and the handle. Each part has their respective stats; however, you can alter the handle to scale off of different stats than the ones it drops with. This opens up a lot of customization and encourages player experimentation, because at no extra-cost, your entire moveset and ability options can change in a matter of seconds. I myself am a Guts sword girl through and through, but even I felt compelled to experiment and eventually beat the game with my own ridiculous combinations. (Note: For me, this self-expression was VERY important in my enjoyment of the game, and I think it's a great innovation to the souls combat formula to allow your players to test out ANY weapon handle's moveset with... every other weapon's blade. Admittedly boss weapons are restricted from being customized and the scaling of both parts' stab/slash stat means that your options for good damage are inherently limited, but it offers so much freedom regardless that I would not mind seeing it return in the sequel.) 

     Story is the point I want to end this off on. For as long as I have cherished Bloodborne's lore, the original trilogy's lore, etc. I have never actually felt connected to the events of the stories presented in souls-like games. There's always been a strange disconnect for me being able to enjoy the challenge of the gameplay rather than caring about the story. I can say Lies of P genuinely moved me in a way no other games in this subgenre have. I believe the most obvious explanation for this is the greater emphasis on dialogue and player onboarding that Lies of P engages in. There is a real sense here with the amount of dialogue you'll receive from a character off-screen during gameplay or in the middle of a boss fight that Neowiz really wanted to make players feel INVOLVED in the big character moments as they are happening, rather than reading about them from a lore description (which is also a method of storytelling present with a lot to read up on that is engaging.) To be clear, I have no issue with this, but I really prefer the focus on character engaging with me, the truths/lies you decide to tell them, and the almost-immediate consequences those decisions can have as they relay their reactions back to you. You can ignore or fight multiple bosses by making a simple decision. I like that. The narrative throughline that is happening above all of the character stories is decently executed, but the character quests is really where Lies of P shines (shoutout to Arlecchino.) Everyone is voice acted phenomenally, and this could not be a Lies of P review without making mention of how pivotal this game's original soundtrack is to the overall experience. The music feels tied to the characters' stories, as many records you can play back at Hotel Krat are received from quest completions. This makes even something as seemingly trivial as playing a record on a record player feel rewarding in itself, as you learn more about an NPC's journey through this world or simply enjoy a great tune in the background. 

     This has become my comfort game, and affectionately so. That doesn't mean it is devoid of things I disliked, as the final area of the game, Arche Abbey, has got to be the single-most tedious level I have played in recent memory. Running through this moody grey wasteland to a grey tower with grey floors and repeated enemies from throughout the entire game got tiring incredibly fast, and it's a shame that the area with this game's pinnacle challenges is also so uninspired in its design. Additionally, I do not think the armor system, dubbed ""Defense parts,"" is particularly exciting. I think this could be fleshed out a little more, but finding more parts throughout the game is almost never exciting because they are always going to be better than your previous find, and they do not change any part of your puppet's appearance. I do like the cosmetics available here, but I definitely prefer the more free-form style of armor expression in other souls-likes. The legion arm system is probably the most disappointing aspect for me, delivering options to customize your limb similar to the prosthetic tools in Sekiro. I do not like the implementation in this game because it feels stiff to me. This is not something I have the knowledge to explain away, but it feels very restricted and with the low amount of legion I always have, it just left a lot to be desired for me because I mainly relied on parrying and counterattacking. 

     Despite my negatives, I adore this game. At the time of writing I have unlocked everything pre-DLC and waiting in anticipation for it as well as the recently announced sequel. If you've ever got a weekend to knockout a surprisingly compelling souls-like, this is absolutely the one for you.",True,english

Combat is fast-paced and has a bit of a learning curve, but is extremely satisfying once it clicks. Learning when to parry vs block, attack with a weapon vs throwbacks vs weapon art was fun and engaging. 

It also looks great and runs smoothly. Even on the Steam Deck with decent graphic settings, I was easily keeping 60 FPS.

Some people have criticized it for not being as open world as a game like Elden Ring, but I see that as a positive aspect of Lies of P. Being able to have a more linear path made the gameplay tight and paced well. It also never felt like it overstayed it's welcome, like I wind up feeling about many open world games.

This is the only game I've ever been motivated to 100% and can't wait for the DLC and sequel.

I'm recommending and warning you against buying this game at the same time.

You have the problems - the game's approach to puzzles is literally insulting to your intelligence. Every time you encounter a puzzle, the companion you're with tells you how to solve it before you even have a chance to take a look around. ""Hey, maybe that thing above you is gonna open a pathway"" and that's literally every puzzle in the game. This should be an accessibility option, you should be able to shut your companions up when you're trying to solve the already trivial puzzles. Sure the combat is still nice, story is nice, but this? Its insulting. Not a single puzzle goes without your companion telling you exactly how to solve it. ""Woow, what if we freeze this?"" and the moment you try anything, they will say something like ""oh no maybe lets try something else"" or ""oh yes we did it"" to indicate the correct solution which they already gave to you to begin with.

LOOK HERE    ---->    The PSN drama isn't as bad here as it was with helldivers, since in helldivers you could buy and play the game for like 3 months before they made it impossible to play for some regions. Here on the other hand you had warnings of the PSN requirement from the very start. Is it okay to have mandatory PSN requirements for a PC version of a single player game? 
Definitely a garbage decision which is clearly one of the biggest flaws of the newer games to come out. Some regions will require you to link a phone number to check your age, I think it is the case for the UK. The other ones will ask for your postal code and real name - it's all going to a third party website which is KNOWN for losing your data to frequent data leaks and hacks. Obviously PSN doesn't care whether you own or even intend to own a PS5 for this, you still need the account because they want to collect more data, it's as simple as this.

Having said that, I think the game itself is great, the unlocked framerate makes it even smoother to play to be honest. Then on the other hand, if you're not okay with this invasion on your personal data security, maybe rethink purchasing it. Same applies to some specific regions of the world which require even more data than other regions. I really suggest you look it up before you buy the game.

Beyond well optimized. Its easily one of my favorite games to play right now.

Aside from running well, this game has been everything I wanted it to be and then some. Compared to the vibe of original FF7, I think this does it a lot of justice. The characters and dialogue are fun, the Shinra menace is equally pronounced etc.

The combat is so smooth I don't even know where to start. But somehow they made a turn-based FF game feel completely naturally FF in an action RPG environment. It's great.

The pacing is good, the side quests are cute and rewarding. I feel like I wasn't wasting much time if any in this game. Everything just sorta flows when you figure out the map.

I can praise this game all day. I'm on the last chapter as of today - I only have a few issues:

-The humor can be out of place sometimes along with the fan service. Particularly when you hear Tifa say 'Man I really need a shower' for the 40th time after a fight it sorta makes you raise an eyebrow, genuinely. That crap is NOT why I'm here and it's sad to me that these adults designing these games find it adds anything to this kinda game.

-I get there is world building and the game GENUINELY at times feels like a re-imagined PS1 game but at times I feel like I'm running down long hallways for no real reason. Are the narrow passages you have to side-step through like...loading screens? Some places are just too big dude. 

-Collect-a-thon. As much as I like that and enjoy it in FF games, this game goes a little too far with the ground clutter. Way too many boxes to destroy. Personally I prefer ~80% of my items to be bought/earned from fights but I'd reckon 70-80% of your important items are in yellow-lit boxes and the battle rewards are mostly for gil. Is what it is. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I would probably enjoy *an hour or 2* Less destroying boxes on the ground.",True,english

- Combat gets interruped every five second because camera gotta zoom on enemy charging attack.
- Knockbacks are insane every time you get close they knock you back and they can lead to combos just becouse.
- Even if you manage to hit enemy they just automatically counter deal damage to you and send you away again.
- Party members are awful they do just bare minimum, they live long enough just becouse enemy mostly targets only character currenty controlled by player.(Also same useless character blows in next cinematic fifty ton boulder with lightning. That just makes me scream.)
- Dodge got no i frames it only avoids aoe and projectiles in melee vs bosses is pretty much useless.
- Attacks cannot be cancelled probably biggest turnback issue i have no idea why but we can only watch next three seconds getting hit and have no other option.

Fans of the original will be pleased with just about everything barring the combat, which you'll either love or hate. The move away from turn-based has been divisive amongst FF fans and while I think it's done well sometimes (like here) and done poorly in others (like FF15, which feels clunky and often time tedious), I do still miss it somewhat.

The PC port is quite polished now and supports HDR, so maxed out it looks like how the original FMVs looked in my kid mind playing OG.

Decent amount of replayability to go through hard mode and find other content, but being the first part of a 3-part epic you could breeze through it and be left wanting more.

Still, between becoming a survival sim or John Rambo every zombie with a s&%t storm of bullets, the game is so very much worth the buy.

With a heavy focus on realism and player choice, this survival sandbox offers a deeply immersive experience that few other games can match. Whether you’re managing your character’s health, building your dream base, or evading hordes of undead, Project Zomboid keeps you on your toes at every moment. Having spent over 730 hours in the game, I can confidently say that it delivers one of the best survival experiences available today.

1. Realism Done Right
Despite the fictional backdrop of a zombie apocalypse, Project Zomboid nails realism in almost every aspect of gameplay. The most valuable tip for any new player is simply: ""What would you do in this situation?"" The game's health system is intricate, with injuries, illnesses, and mental states all playing a role. Clothes protect you from zombie bites, degrade over time, and help regulate body temperature, which is vital. Mechanics like repairing vehicles, dealing with character traits and professions, and managing inventory weight make everything feel real. I especially love how character emotions and moods affect gameplay – it’s small touches like these that elevate Project Zomboid to another level of immersion.

2. An Open World That Never Ends
The current game world is massive, and despite having played over 730 hours, I still didn't explore all the areas. I admire the sheer size of the map, and with upcoming updates promising to expand it further and even include randomly generated maps in the distant future. Project Zomboid also offers infinite gameplay and replayability. It’s one of those survival games you can play over and over without ever getting tired.

3. Sandbox Customization Options
One of my favorite aspects is the ability to tailor the world to your liking. From the number and behavior of zombies to loot distribution, characters (players), and more, Project Zomboid lets you tweak almost anything. It gives you the power to create a world that fits your personal playstyle or challenge yourself with tougher scenarios.

4. Character Creation and Professions
This is hands-down one of my favorite features in the game. Choosing different professions and character traits, both positive and negative, significantly changes how the game plays. I also appreciate the subtle bonuses and drawbacks that aren’t immediately obvious – it adds an extra layer of depth. The balance in this system is present, too, so don’t expect to create an overpowered character unless you tweak the sandbox settings to do so!

5. Community Mods
While Project Zomboid doesn’t need mods to be great, the fact that they’re available is a huge bonus. The modding community has added incredible content, from enhanced realism to new vehicles, traits, weapons, and crafting options. There’s too much to describe in one review! That said, I recommend playing without mods at first to truly grasp the game’s mechanics, but later on, mods can make the experience even better.

6. Skill Levels and Physical Attributes
Project Zomboid features an extensive skill system that allows players to improve their characters through practice and experience. Skills are divided into categories like combat, crafting, survival, and agility, each having a noticeable impact on gameplay. Combat skills such as aiming and reloading become crucial for firearm users, while melee skills like blunt and blade proficiency determine how effective you are with weapons like baseball bats or axes. Crafting skills, including carpentry, metalworking, and tailoring, let you fortify your base, repair clothes, or even create tools from scratch.
Survival skills like foraging and fishing allow you to live off the land when resources run dry, and farming lets you grow your own food, providing a sustainable source of nutrition. Agility skills, such as sneaking and lightfooted, are essential for staying hidden from zombies, while sprinting helps you escape when the situation gets dire.
Physical attributes like strength and fitness are equally important, as they directly affect how much weight you can carry, how fast you tire, and how effective you are in combat. Improving your strength means you can carry heavier loads and hit harder with melee attacks, while better fitness ensures you can run longer distances and recover faster from exhaustion. Each skill progresses the more you use it, making every action in the game feel meaningful and rewarding.

7. Intriguing (But Optional) Lore
While the storyline isn’t central to the player’s experience yet, it does exist, and it’s fascinating. I only started diving into the game’s lore after playing for about 500 hours, and once I did, I was hooked. I went so far as to read up on the game’s backstory online (beware of spoilers!) Exploring the lore adds a new dimension to the game. I highly recommend getting to know the lore yourself!

8. A Sandbox Experience
Want to build? Build. Want to destroy? Go ahead. In Project Zomboid, your creativity (and characters human possibilities) are your only limits. The only challenge is gathering materials, which makes sense given the post-apocalyptic setting. But with enough time and motivation, you can accomplish incredible things. This open-ended approach is perfect for players who enjoy creating and building their own worlds.

9. Active Developer Support
The game is still in early access, and while it may not be updated on a daily basis, the developers deliver large, meaningful updates. They listen to player feedback, fix bugs, and continue to improve the game without ignoring the community, which is something I greatly respect.

10. Hidden Depths
Just when you think you’ve learned everything there is to know about Project Zomboid, it surprises you. The game is full of hidden mechanics and features that add to the depth of the experience. I’ve had several moments where I thought I had mastered the game, only to discover a new layer of complexity. It’s a game that keeps on giving.

11. Fair Price
Finally, let’s talk about the price. For what Project Zomboid offers, the price is perfect. But if you’re looking to save a bit of money, it’s always worth waiting for a sale. Either way, you’re getting your money’s worth for this gem of a game.

Project Zomboid is a truly exceptional survival game that combines deep realism with sandbox freedom. Whether you're fighting off zombies, building your own fortress, or scavenging for supplies, every moment feels impactful. With continuous updates, an active modding community, and endless replayability, it’s a game that will keep you coming back for more. I can’t recommend it highly enough to fans of survival games or anyone looking for a challenging, immersive experience.",True,english

HOWEVER, the biggest concern is the servers they have. Right now there's only realistically 4-5 servers running and I hear EU servers arent always up and if you're like me who lives in Australia which needs a Oceania server which doesnt exist then you're looking about 250 ping to play which lags liike crazy on Asia & US server.
Will change to a thumbs up once they've added new servers in hopefully this game continues to grow as I have high hopes for it!

UPDATE: Pretty disappointed at how the management is with this game as they try to do a lot of banning and not to mention banning stream snipers instead of focusing more time on actually trying to open new servers up so to get more exposure for the game.....Right now it's kind of a turn off so decided to uninstall it.

UPDATE 2: The good news is that other servers are up but unfortunately it's leaving players wants to support that are in the Oceania region super dead clearly the devs should be more transparent about this so now they just seem to avoid the question all together........",False,english

Still, between becoming a survival sim or John Rambo every zombie with a s&%t storm of bullets, the game is so very much worth the buy.

With a heavy focus on realism and player choice, this survival sandbox offers a deeply immersive experience that few other games can match. Whether you’re managing your character’s health, building your dream base, or evading hordes of undead, Project Zomboid keeps you on your toes at every moment. Having spent over 730 hours in the game, I can confidently say that it delivers one of the best survival experiences available today.

1. Realism Done Right
Despite the fictional backdrop of a zombie apocalypse, Project Zomboid nails realism in almost every aspect of gameplay. The most valuable tip for any new player is simply: ""What would you do in this situation?"" The game's health system is intricate, with injuries, illnesses, and mental states all playing a role. Clothes protect you from zombie bites, degrade over time, and help regulate body temperature, which is vital. Mechanics like repairing vehicles, dealing with character traits and professions, and managing inventory weight make everything feel real. I especially love how character emotions and moods affect gameplay – it’s small touches like these that elevate Project Zomboid to another level of immersion.

2. An Open World That Never Ends
The current game world is massive, and despite having played over 730 hours, I still didn't explore all the areas. I admire the sheer size of the map, and with upcoming updates promising to expand it further and even include randomly generated maps in the distant future. Project Zomboid also offers infinite gameplay and replayability. It’s one of those survival games you can play over and over without ever getting tired.

3. Sandbox Customization Options
One of my favorite aspects is the ability to tailor the world to your liking. From the number and behavior of zombies to loot distribution, characters (players), and more, Project Zomboid lets you tweak almost anything. It gives you the power to create a world that fits your personal playstyle or challenge yourself with tougher scenarios.

4. Character Creation and Professions
This is hands-down one of my favorite features in the game. Choosing different professions and character traits, both positive and negative, significantly changes how the game plays. I also appreciate the subtle bonuses and drawbacks that aren’t immediately obvious – it adds an extra layer of depth. The balance in this system is present, too, so don’t expect to create an overpowered character unless you tweak the sandbox settings to do so!

5. Community Mods
While Project Zomboid doesn’t need mods to be great, the fact that they’re available is a huge bonus. The modding community has added incredible content, from enhanced realism to new vehicles, traits, weapons, and crafting options. There’s too much to describe in one review! That said, I recommend playing without mods at first to truly grasp the game’s mechanics, but later on, mods can make the experience even better.

6. Skill Levels and Physical Attributes
Project Zomboid features an extensive skill system that allows players to improve their characters through practice and experience. Skills are divided into categories like combat, crafting, survival, and agility, each having a noticeable impact on gameplay. Combat skills such as aiming and reloading become crucial for firearm users, while melee skills like blunt and blade proficiency determine how effective you are with weapons like baseball bats or axes. Crafting skills, including carpentry, metalworking, and tailoring, let you fortify your base, repair clothes, or even create tools from scratch.
Survival skills like foraging and fishing allow you to live off the land when resources run dry, and farming lets you grow your own food, providing a sustainable source of nutrition. Agility skills, such as sneaking and lightfooted, are essential for staying hidden from zombies, while sprinting helps you escape when the situation gets dire.
Physical attributes like strength and fitness are equally important, as they directly affect how much weight you can carry, how fast you tire, and how effective you are in combat. Improving your strength means you can carry heavier loads and hit harder with melee attacks, while better fitness ensures you can run longer distances and recover faster from exhaustion. Each skill progresses the more you use it, making every action in the game feel meaningful and rewarding.

7. Intriguing (But Optional) Lore
While the storyline isn’t central to the player’s experience yet, it does exist, and it’s fascinating. I only started diving into the game’s lore after playing for about 500 hours, and once I did, I was hooked. I went so far as to read up on the game’s backstory online (beware of spoilers!) Exploring the lore adds a new dimension to the game. I highly recommend getting to know the lore yourself!

8. A Sandbox Experience
Want to build? Build. Want to destroy? Go ahead. In Project Zomboid, your creativity (and characters human possibilities) are your only limits. The only challenge is gathering materials, which makes sense given the post-apocalyptic setting. But with enough time and motivation, you can accomplish incredible things. This open-ended approach is perfect for players who enjoy creating and building their own worlds.

9. Active Developer Support
The game is still in early access, and while it may not be updated on a daily basis, the developers deliver large, meaningful updates. They listen to player feedback, fix bugs, and continue to improve the game without ignoring the community, which is something I greatly respect.

10. Hidden Depths
Just when you think you’ve learned everything there is to know about Project Zomboid, it surprises you. The game is full of hidden mechanics and features that add to the depth of the experience. I’ve had several moments where I thought I had mastered the game, only to discover a new layer of complexity. It’s a game that keeps on giving.

11. Fair Price
Finally, let’s talk about the price. For what Project Zomboid offers, the price is perfect. But if you’re looking to save a bit of money, it’s always worth waiting for a sale. Either way, you’re getting your money’s worth for this gem of a game.

Project Zomboid is a truly exceptional survival game that combines deep realism with sandbox freedom. Whether you're fighting off zombies, building your own fortress, or scavenging for supplies, every moment feels impactful. With continuous updates, an active modding community, and endless replayability, it’s a game that will keep you coming back for more. I can’t recommend it highly enough to fans of survival games or anyone looking for a challenging, immersive experience.",True,english

QOL is decidedly lacking as well, a prime example of which is the level restricted access to blueprinting. Another good example of poor QOL is that everytime you open a number of menus (you will do this a lot) it plays a smoke-detectoresque beep/chirp the volume of which is controlled by main volume. This is a particularly poignant example of poor QOL because so many other sounds have separate sound control sliders, and the one set of sounds that doesn't is the single one that I would have liked to have muted.

That being said: [b]Satisfactory is not stressful in the slightest,[/b] If you do start to feel overwhelmed by the factory, you can explore a absolutely massive map and collect materials to unwind.

Patience. This game requires you to be patient with its storytelling. The above quote perfectly describes the game with its phenomenal storytelling and visuals. The game devs have carefully crafted the way the story is being presented. The cutscenes might make some players hesitant to continue, but just be patient and keep progressing, the end is worth it.

I myself have no problem sitting back and absorbing the story through cutscenes. The grappling chain arm and game mechanics have good momentum to enjoy the gameplay. I wish that there were some more upgrades or weapons customization but it's still fun and exciting trying to clear the levels.

Saying Sanabi is a Katana Zero clone would be a huge disservice to this game. To me, both are exceptional gems.

But before I continue to sing my praises to this game, what exactly is Sanabi?

Well, in this action platformer game, you play as a retired veteran with a simple mission, which is to hunt an entity called ""Sanabi"". To do this, you will use your chain hook prosthetic arm to get around a city called Mago. This weapon can also be used to hook yourself to the enemies, destroying them in the process.

This grappling hook mechanism means that you will spend most of your time in the air, going from one platform to another, from one enemy to another, from one boss to another. And when done right, it feels oh so good, especially because of the tight movement. Makes you feel unstoppable, and it gets the adrenaline pumping!

I said ""when done right"", because at first, I struggled getting used to the grappling hook gameplay and gamepad controls. Because not only you can hook the enemy, you can boost yourself, slow down time, jump, and so much more. But overtime, I learned to get good and finally experienced that flow state.

Surprisingly, even with this addicting gameplay formula, my favorite part of Sanabi is still the story. Without spoiling anything, you will be confused at first because of the mysteries surrounding Sanabi and Mago are pretty complicated, but once you connect the dots, it will be mind blowing. 

At least mine did, that's for sure. It makes me want to replay the whole game instantly to see all the hints I missed.

Not only mind blowing, Sanabi's story has a lot of heart thanks to its characters. Mind you, Sanabi doesn't have too many characters, since you spend most of your time with a hacker girl named Mari, who's helping you find Sanabi, and her robot companion Mufin.

While Mari might be too talkative to some, I found her character very charming, I really enjoyed her funny personality and antics, and I think the game definitely won't be the same without Mari.

I was too invested in the story of Sanabi, the retired veteran, and Mari. By the end of the game, I was left sobbing my eyes out, heck, I instantly went to write a review, three years after I wrote my previous review.

All of these positive points, combined with the epic soundtracks and the eye catching pixel art, makes the game a complete package worth checking out, even in full price. Scratch that, I insist YOU to try out this game if you love some fast paced action gameplay and heart tugging storytelling.

The story, the artstyle, the game mechanics, the world-building, and the soundtrack are all top notch. It does however get really tedious at times. It's clearly heavily inspired by Katana Zero, but where Katana Zero effortlessly succeeds in integrating an intriguing plotline with its fast-paced gameplay. This one fails; miserably at times. It felt like the cutscenes and gameplay were constantly interrupting each other, the second you get into the gameplay and are being thrown challenging enemies, you're interrupted by a cutscene twice as long, and when the story gets interesting, you're interrupted with the gameplay. At some point it was hard to enjoy the game cause there was this constant anticipation that the gameplay would come to a grinding halt with a dense cutscene.
I played the speedrun after completing the campaign, and playing it felt leagues better than story mode, the gameplay felt more connected and fluid.
The story is definitely worth experiencing but I don't think it warrants the awful gameplay to cutscene ratio. A lot of it could have been condensed, some of it could have been shown in collectables or records people who are interested could go out of their way to find, having cutscenes between longer sequences of gameplay, etc.

This is a very good game, but it is certainly not a game that deserves an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" tag.  Here's why:

(1) The best part of this game is the story; there is little doubt about that. Though the story is very good, it is absolutely not original, as it is basically an exact copy of a couple very specific movies. Still, the story is worth getting through. I suggest you don't read anything about it and just go through it without any spoilers of any type, even the trailers.

(2) The problem with this ""game"" is that there is too much emphasis on the story.  You will spend significantly more time watching cut scenes and reading dialogue than actually playing.  That sounds like an exaggeration, but it is 100% true. There is LESS TIME SPENT ON GAMEPLAY THAN ON CUT SCENES. 

(3) The game took some obvious inspiration from Bionic Commando.  Swinging around is fun, but that is basically all you do.  There is little combat here and it is as simplistic as you can possibly get while still calling this a game. 

(4) It way too easy. The challenge of the game is figuring out and becoming adept with the controls.  Once you do that, you fly through the game with ease. 

Some of the reviews compare this to Katana Zero, even saying that it is better than Katana Zero.  I don't think this game is playing in the same league as Katana Zero.  Katana Zero is a far superior game. 

This could have been a legitimate classic if there was more time spent on gameplay and less on cut scenes. This game is a B.  I am not suggesting that you should not play it, as it has its fun parts, but this is really more a movie than a video game.",True,english

Each character has their own unique in-game upgrade trees, in addition to the overarching meta upgrades you accumulate between runs. There's a lot of different weapons, many of which have their own quirk or special move. I'm a big fan of Daefaning Mortar, a huge energy cannon that can release a close-range burst or an artillery salvo.

Difficulty has its ups and down, with it being possible to stack a lot of damage multipliers and just nuke everything you look at, but conversely it's easy to get killed if you get careless. In co-op you can revive each other, and even in solo play there's the option to add bot teammates. The bots are mostly training wheels, they're practically immortal and will rez you reliably, but they're good for practice or experimenting with wacky builds.

Gotta give the devs credit for handling their new ""seasonal"" updates tastefully. There's no FOMO involved; You can freely swap around between the different season mechanics, and anything you didn't get in its battlepass equivalent is placed into a general store to unlock with the meta currency already in the game.",True,english

I love that there is some darkness and there some automation and base building. Its not the most polished game (there are improvements being made all the time though) but it does not have to be, its an absolute blast... Get some friends start a server and put your Pals to work. 
From memory one of the only games I brought at or very close to full price, no regrets. 

The main reason is because nintendo F%^king suck. They have had so long to innovate Pokemon and bring this up to date and in line with other innovative games, Arceus even though this was an innovation for them, for an IP that is so big it was phoned in. 
It sucks to see a beloved franchise like Pokemon stagnate and get wasted like this. Enter Palworld, Pocketpair dared to step up to the line that nintendo drew in the sand and instead of nintendo looking in the mirror for self-reflection and striving for perfection in their games..... They litigate and stifle innovation in companies that are willing to innovate. 

Thank you Pocketpair you truly deserve far more than a positive review for your truly fun game and for standing up for innovation, the community is behind you 100%.",True,english

+ The story is actually quite good with some twists in it
+ for some reason it still works quite well if you don't decide to use cheat tackle
+ artworks are accaptable, getting more common near the end
+ Reduced complexity of combat fits well to the overall reduced state
+ it works completely fine without the optional content 

Cons:
- sadly, usage of cheat tackle is barely relevant with a lot of missed opportunities to use it properly
- barely challenging (save for beginning and end), endcontent tour is kinda off too
- bad exploration, not many secrets/Yarimon, puzzles, trainer, whatnot - feels dull
- protags design was not my cup of tea - I get why he's like that tho

- I love sex loving girls, as such, I don't like elements like being brainwashed/hypnotised (aka game is similar to pokemon but only MC get's ""lucky"" and you get it without me spoiling more), master/toilet... if you played enough H games you know what I mean, but it's not bad in this game since due to ""plot"" the girls are asking vs other games where the guy force himself. Though I hope this won't be true later on....

- I am not a fan of fetishes involving body fluids, and while ""it""'s white for the most part, when ""finishing"" ""it""'s yellow with tons of ""it"" that is just truly disgusting since it reminds me of rotten... you know what, let me not finish. Because again... this is just the ""bad part"" section""

- For the adult restoration patch, you need to create and account and buy (free, no card details and so on) from the publisher's website. And I hope I make it clear it's only for +18. And just for your own info, if you got the DLC (Steam) for this game, on the publishers website, you don't need both patches, just the one with the DLC (again, free), since that one covers both the standard as well as the DLC (around 2 GB)
-Bad endings... you know what, let me not even open this topic...

Neutral
-/+ you are stuck with partner since it's very important for the story, aka you can't replace.
-/+ just like in pokemon you need/there is a lot to explore and battle other trainers
-/+ H Scenes are set, so this does lack the freedom to chose ""preferences""
-/+ Art of the monsters, as well as MC. I can't how many, but most of the monster, I saw in other rpg maker games, aka I assume they are free to use art...

Now the good part:
+ While not everything, this game is a better version of the early Pokemon games. And it's very good on top.
+ Nothing to complicated, aka if you want easily win every battle just select easy
+ The +18 art is one of the best I saw for RPG Maker type of game. Only visual novels and Hentai videos had better then this game, but few RPG maker type (maybe some Wolf RPG ones but I'm going off course), and it's also Uncensored (no mosaic) including X ray for some. The angle is also amazing since you can see very well what you want. Also, while it's not video animation, aka still looped images but give the sensation of being animated, it it's once again, one of the best GIF CG I saw in any RPG Maker game.
+ It's fun to play, explore, chat with NPC for extra info (sometimes), and find new events.
+ Steam has a ""if less then 2 hours played in less then 2 weeks since patches, you can refund for full price"", and I am sure that said 2 hours is more then enough for you to tell if you like this game (even if not everything).",True,english

If you are a fan of creature collecting games, this one is worth giving a try. It's got a a simple to understand combat system and a surprisingly good story for an adult themed game that you wouldn't expect. The character designs are really well done, I like how every character has their own visual design to stand out and give them personality. The H-scenes are a bit choppy at times, probably the biggest weakness of the game if you install the patches but there are still some entertaining scenes as well. They do feel a bit heavy at times when you are just trying to push through the game though. 

 combat consists of Yarimon that fall into 1 of 7 types. water, fire, wind, earth, dark, light and normal. with normal doing neutral damage against all types. water>fire>wind>earth>water and finally dark and light both being strong against the other. It's a very simple system with every Yarimon weakness told to you at the start of a battle so there is no guess work.

When it comes to moves, there is no PP like you would find in pokemon but it does have a cooldown system. Of your 4 moves weaker attacks will be able to be used back to back and as you learn more powerful moves, you will find that they have longer cooldowns which adds a surprising amount of depth you wouldn't really expect. As for difficulty, I did a run that didn't use the cheat tackle move which will 1 shot any Yarimon but is limited to 1 time a battle.this added a level of difficulty that wasn't too hard to overcome with a bit of experience but did create a few challenges in the early game. 

Going more into the difficulty, one thing I really enjoyed was that you weren't allowed to over level your Yarimon from the start of the game. Your Yarimon are capped at your trainer level which only increases when you defeat another trainer so there is very little reason to grind on wild Yarimon. This also makes trainer battles important and finding trainers that you can defeat becomes a challenge you need to overcome in the early game. When it comes to trainers, you will never be forced into a battle with one. You can always decline a battle and before the battle starts, you get to see how many and at what level the opponents Yarimon are so you will not be caught off guard when entering a fight. 

No creature collecting game is complete without a good share of monsters to collect and Yarimono offers 151 (plus your starter) Yarimon to collect. Almost all Yarimon can evolve  besides approximately 5, 3 of which are your legendary trio stand ins. At the start of battles you can attempt to catch a Yarimon and after using an item on it, then after defeating it in battle it will join you without fail. No random luck required. Same thing goes with running away, running is always 100% successful making finding the Yarimon you are looking for a breeze. Throw in a handy little info section in the bottom right of every screen and whenever you enter grass you will know exactly what Yarimon appear there so you can easily find what ones you haven't befriended yet. Very helpful.

Finally the story might be the biggest surprise with me. I didn't think a game that combines adult content and creature capturing was going to have a splatted together story but I was dead wrong. As you make your way through the ranks to try and become the Yarimon Champion and with the Yarimon Tournament, there begins to be signs of a pretty dark and sinister events going on. Without going too much into details, the story gave me vibes of gens 6 and 8 of pokemon. The story even finds a way to tie in your own characters childhood and early game weakness as well as explain why the adult content stuff is happening. All in all, there is a lot more to the story than I would have given it credit for going in. I was surprised how much the story hooked me.


overall i think the game is a solid 8 out of 10. It isn't extremely long, I was able to do a single play through getting all the achievements and unlocking everything there was to see over 3 days in slightly under 20 hours. I finished the game at level 144 which may seem like a lot but it really isn't as DLC trainers can get up to 159 (might be higher). If you like creature collection give this game a shot.",True,english

So I'd say 10-15 hours is the amount of game play time you'll get from this game. I also play with the patch that can be downloaded from the publisher's website and this review will be based on that.

Overall, Yarimono is a solid game that's worth the price I paid for. HOWEVER, before you buy the game, I'd recommend looking Nyuu's work online first. While I enjoyed the art style a lot, I know that some people dislike it and it might ended up not being your cup of tea.

In terms of game play, it is similar to other catch-em-all games out there. So I'm not gonna touch on that too much and other reviews can probably give deeper insights than mine.

I will, however, talk about the eroge aspect of the game in a bit more detail. There are 76 partners that have a scene with you, with multiple having more than one scenes. In total, I'd estimate the amount of unique scenes close to 130-150 scenes. Each scene are drawn well, and all have some animation to go along with it, which I think is a nice touch.

In terms of theme, it stays true to Nyuu's style of brainwash, ugly bastard, with a side of urination. This is why I strongly recommend looking their work first before getting the game, since these themes might not be everyone's cup of tea. With that said, those who don't mind these themes will definitely enjoy what the game has to offer.

As for the story, I'd put it around 6-7/10. There are emotional moments for sure and it's better than 90% of the eroges out there. However, it still is pretty simple and straightforward. There will be moments that felt weird or forced to make the plot moves. There are also some weird translations and typo if you're playing on the English version. Most dialogues will still make sense, but it just wouldn't flow too well. 

With that said, this game is an easy recommendation for me. I definitely enjoyed it.",True,english

Still, the scenes are well drawn and well animated. 10/10 on art style

 The game itself is also very great, there absolutely is difficulty in the game if you choose to avoid using the ""cheat tackle"" move and it stands on its own as a solid monster-taming game. 8/10 on gameplay

The story... was far better than I was expecting it to be. Had some pretty great twists that I did not see coming, and it did a good job of bringing it all together towards the end, I had moments where I was starting to piece things together before things were actually revealed. 9/10 on story

Overall I would say this game is a strong 9/10 and absolutely worth the full price, as I've definitely gotten my moneys worth and more out of it. I would love to play additional DLC or a sequel to this.",True,english

This game is hard, like vary hard, if you are new you will die a lot to older players.  So here are a few things you can do to get better at the game.

1. Don't cheat.  You will not get better if you do cheat and you will make the game worse by doing so.
2. Listen to your surroundings.  This can make you win or loss a game just because you could not hear where the other players shots are coming from so you put your back towards the player shooting at you instead of facing them.
3. Do not land at popular sites, this is an easy and fast way to go back to the lobby, instead look for locations at least 1km from where the plane is flying and go there.
4. Play with friends and use VOIP.  You can use the in game VOIP, but what I use is Discord.
5. Don't go more then 100 m from your team mates.  This way when one of you is in trouble, 3 of your team mates are at positions to aid you.  Also don't be to close to each other, as this makes you easier to spot and makes it harder for you and your team mates to return fire when you are in a fire fight.
6. When you see someone, ping them so your team mates know where they are and can aid it taking them down.
7. Take a automatic weapon and a long range weapon (DMR or SR).  My suggestion for a new player is a SMG and a DMR.  For SMG use one of the 3, UMP, VECTOR, MP5K.  As for DMR's, use SLR or DRAGUNOV.
8. Carry at least 4 First Aid kits, 10 bandages, and 4 boosts.
9. Carry 2-3 Smoke grenades.
10. Just have fun.

EA FC 25 has become much more than just a football simulation game—it’s an obsession for many, almost to the point of addiction. The game’s allure lies not only in its realistic gameplay but in the psychological hooks embedded within its most popular mode, Ultimate Team. Here, players build their dream squads by purchasing and opening virtual packs, hoping to land high-rated players. The randomness of the pack openings, combined with the constant updates of new content and challenges, can feel like a never-ending cycle, which easily mirrors the addictive behaviors seen in gambling. Spending real money on virtual packs in EA FC 25 often feels like buying lottery tickets, with the dopamine rush from landing a rare player driving players to keep spending, hoping for better results next time. This practice has been widely criticized for promoting gambling habits, particularly among younger players, who might not fully grasp the financial consequences.

Personally, EA FC 25 triggers a unique frustration. Despite investing hours into perfecting skills, tweaking formations, and optimizing my Ultimate Team, the game often feels unfair. Matches can be decided by tiny, sometimes random moments—an AI glitch, a poor refereeing decision, or a lucky bounce—leaving me feeling powerless. What makes it worse is when the players you worked so hard (or spent so much) to acquire seem to underperform, leading to pure rage. The gameplay mechanics sometimes feel deliberately designed to push you into spending more, as if the better players you need to succeed are always just out of reach, unless you're willing to pay. This cycle of frustration, combined with the temptation of opening ""just one more pack,"" turns what should be a fun experience into something more stressful and, at times, toxic. The game manages to tap into that part of your brain that makes you feel like you’re on the verge of a breakthrough, but in reality, it’s pulling you deeper into the grind, causing more frustration and emotional investment than it should.",False,english

I didn't play the first one, but heard much about it. So I'm not comparing it to anything, but to me this game is a masterclass in immersion and natural as well as guided storytelling. The mechanics are great and feel different from other games. It's original. The game doesn't hold your hand, the prologue serves as a tutorial, but doesn't feel like a tutorial: You're immediately fighting for survival, but the game never feels unfair. Here and there I wished the consequences of my actions were clearer, but you can always reload, and I suggest making multiple saves. I never got soft locked, but I'm sure you can.

You explore the world as you explore mechanics and the story unfolds. The story feels very authentically interlinked with what you do. When factions were mad at me, they had good reason to, and they all have reasonable stances, that just happen to conflict very often. Moral choices are nuanced.

You will be managing and balancing dozens of things at the same time, have to make sacrifices, sometimes heavy ones, but you always have clear and realistic short and long-term goals. Some self-imposed, some from the game's plot, and some just to keep your people alive and if possible, happy. For a city management game it's extremely exciting. Oftentimes I barely scraped by.

Other developers can learn from this. How to trust your audience: show them the basic with more show than tell, then throw them into the cold water and let them figure it out.

Special shout out to the the graphics and sound design. It's actually a very pretty game and I wish I could zoom in more (the zoom-in on generators doesn't do it for me).

Now that I finished the campaign I can't wait to play the sandbox mode, which seems pretty fleshed out with 7 starting locations and completely different factions from story mode.",True,english

They really improved it."" What the devs did with Frostpunk 2 is revamp the game to be almost a new game. 

You feel the constant pressure of your choices. Everything is on the brink of collapse as you try to balance the politics, failing machinery, and ever encroaching cold with resources that are few and far and between. This truly feels like a ""survival, post-apocalyptic setting"". You desperately need more food, you finally find some frozen food stores under the ice. So you go to build an extraction district to try and pull the resources out. Some of the workforce mining the coal out of the ice died from starvation or the frost. Now you do not have enough workers. So you pull from another area. Some of the children start to go feral as the city starts to descend into anarchy. The coal mine is not producing coal as it dries up, so your generator holding the cold barely at bay is running out of fuel now.  You make a deal with a colony for some of their oil to keep the heat on for a little longer. In doing so, one of the rising factions in the city begins to oppose you because they do not like the deal you made. 

Its a constant struggle of back and forth that makes you feel you are really on the precipice of extinction and about to go over. 
Game play is outstanding. Graphics and audio are great. Some audio sound bite loops (such as when you click on one of the factions) can get old fast. Minor nitpicking aside, this game is absolutely fantastic. No you do not need to buy the first game at all. This is well worth the 45 bucks to a somewhat small studio for game play that is infinitely better than any of the sludge the ""AAA"" studios will ever produce.",True,english

If there was a neutral rating I would give it. There is a good core of the game here, keeping much of the spirit of the first game.There is a good core of the game here, keeping much of the spirit of the first game.

Pros 
1 - Game looks great. Good atmosphere and art on the menus. Colors and well done to lean into the overall dystopia steam punk vibe. 

2 - More of a natural society progression. You don't just get to choose what society you'll be with a simple choice. Your laws, the factions you favor and your choices in events grow your society. This leads to tech and law unlocks. Makes for a fun RP experience and something refreshing to see in a city builder.

3 - Most of the core mechanics of the first game are intact, so resources and heat management especially are still very much the priority.  

4 - Game still has a great soundtrack and atmosphere all around.

Neutral 

1 -  It's on a larger scale than the first game so you don't build individual buildings, you just build districts. Your ascetic control of your colony is basically non-existent. For me this is irksome, but this really comes down to a personal preference. I miss being able to craft my colony to look a certain way. But this is purely an ascetic issue and I can't knock the game for it. 

Cons 

1 - This game should have an early access tag. It has several small bugs that can really just kill your run. You'll spend some amount of time online trying to figure out what happened until you realize it's a bug.
                - Example - First scenario in new london, you establish a colony for oil. My progress just stopped even with ample frost teams. I paused all other outpots to get more frost teams, that did not restart progress. When I sent people to establish the colony, it reduce the number of works in all my buildings in new london. This caused me to have less frost teams. Even after increasing worker count, my colony would not progress in building. Had to reload. Seems like a minor bug, but annoying because if you don't catch it right away it can kill your run.


2 - QoL is poor. Resource management is an integral part of this game. Everything is a slider when it comes to resources, being workers or raw materials. Some you can get precise numbers on because the slider also has small button allowing 1 quantity changes. Others do not have this option, because reasons. So you sometimes have exact control over how many workers are somewhere, or how many resources you send/receive. Other times you just get to throw a handful of workers at a new colony and hope it's close enough to the number you want. Also you can't scroll with arrow key, or middle mouse with the sliders either. Just click and hold. You also can't cancel buildings in progress, and if you lay a building down wrong have to just deal with it later. You also while planning to build, can only cancel in sequential order. Can't click on a tile to cancel just one and build somewhere else. Minor issue but again, just more lifting for the user for seemingly no reason. 

3 - UI is bad, like all form over function bad. You can hotkey to most important things, which is fine. You can also hover over your resources and most of the numbers up top to see a better breakdown. But the idea to have the 5 categories hang below your top UI not really be intractable at all is baffling to me. The worse they get, the longer the tail they get, which can end up cluttering the top of your screen. You also get zero information about them. Some are derived stats, some are all ready covered in your resource needs. They feel redundant and don't serve much purpose beyond the look. You also cannot short cut most actions in a district. It has an empty building slot? Well can't click on the building slot to do anything. Have to exit looking at the district, go to your buildings build menu which is different from your district build menu, find the right sub category for the building you want, then select it. Seems like a minor gripe but like...you can't build any of the buildings outside of their specific district type besides heat ones. Why do they need their own menu, why can they not be done from the district menu? They're upgrades, not independent items. Game becomes more dependent on pause with small things like this. 

4 - Game is gonna chug after you set up some colonies and managing more than one city. Needs some performance optimization.",False,english

For example, I've encountered a few weird UI glitches. That's to say nothing of the day-1 patch ""temporary fix"" for what is a pretty jarring audio crackling issue in big cities. It's not a good look to release it like this.

Please, developers, and I mean all game developers, not just 11-Bit Studios: Polish off your games. People will forgive less obvious bugs, but when you release a game with glaring issues that *had* to have been apparent prior to release, it's really bad form. Day-1 patches for these kinds of issues don't really mitigate the optics, in my book. Day-1 patches say to me, ""we know the game isn't finished, but we're releasing it anyway.""

But it shows that Konami wants to get away from the recycle-old-game-and-stick-a-new-name-on scheme. Some ideas and approaches are very good (more movements without the ball, cross-play, transitionless corners and throw-ins, etc...), but the implementation is very miserable. To be honest, even old functions that have always worked flawlessly are miserable now. In the end, this just shows how hard it actually is to bring a completely new game to market instead of remarketing the same game for full price. I like the approach of putting more effort into the football games, bringing new features and taking risks. It's a shame that PES flopped this year, but since it's free, you shouldn't bitch so much. Kudos to Konami for daring to make this right step. I'll wait for EFootball until it's ready.

Edit.

The updated version of EFootball is not comparable to the beta version which was very criticized. The game runs very smoothly and I hardly had any bugs, the graphics and animations look very realistic especially on high graphics settings. The game dynamics are rarely disturbed by fading to freekicks or throw-ins, the game continues to run while the players are getting the ball ready, which is very good. When there are cut scenes they are well used and hardly interfere. It feels more like watching a game on TV.
The game dynamics have also improved a lot, offensive players move smartly and the defense also makes few mistakes. In order to get a goal situation you have to either trick the opponent to open up passing situations or outplay the opponent with well-directed passes. At the moment, besides the friendly matches and online games, there is only the Dream Team mode, where you create and manage a team online and play against the AI or online games. It is good that you can buy the standard players directly and do not have to pull from ""packs"". These then start at level 0 and you have to level them up to their normal value and then you can go a bit beyond that. Very good I found here the possibility that you can choose the value upgrades yourself and thus can form your perfect player. You can e.g. skill MBappe to be more focused on speed and dribbling to let him play more on the wing or increase the values for finishing and attacking to set him up as a center forward. The choice is up to you. Since Efootball is free, there is a fear that the game will become pay-to-win. So far, however, I have been able to do well with my non-pay-to-win team and have not had the feeling that I had a big disadvantage compared to the other players. The good thing is that Featured players and the ""normal form"" of the same players usually have the same values when they are at the highest level. Featured players just start at a higher value and don't need to level up as long. Also, Featured players often have an alternate focus on skills. Only some legend players that are hard to get are a lot better than the ""normal"" counterparts. I would have been happy if legendaries had been just as good and you only acquired them, for example, if you were a big fan, so as not to break the balance of the game. But so far opponents had only 2-3 legends in the team and the difference was not so big that you have no chance against them.

All in all, I think the game is good, it's fun and brings a lot of new features. But some corners must still be tweaked.",True,english

The mechanics have been refined and expanded, making the game even more immersive. My first campaign was a wild ride, and I loved it.

I started as Duchess Matilda of Tuscany, and things quickly went out of control. After committing the ""crime"" of fornication, I had to deal with the consequences not once, but twice: first, when the child was born, and then when someone blackmailed me to reveal the father’s identity. I refused. My liege, Kaiser Heinrich IV of the Holy Roman Empire, decided to arrest me twice, ruining my reputation and legitimacy. To make matters worse, he revoked some of my titles, reducing me from a Duchess to a Countess.

I plotted an assassination scheme against the Kaiser, and to my surprise, it worked. With a new liege, I set my sights on recovering my lost titles. I declared war on my Duke and, after a tense battle, managed to reclaim two of them. While I didn't get back all of my original titles (I went from 6 down to 4), it was still a lot of fun.

By the end of Matilda's life, she held 10 titles. It was an unexpected journey, but that’s what makes the game so enjoyable, you never quite know where things will end up.",True,english

(My total playing hours are over 100 by the way but started on a different clock).

The reasons are in two categories, (a) the unexpected playability factor and (b) the medieval simulator factor.

A - Playability - Paradox have finally found the sweet spot between complexity and accessibility. I did not come to CK3 with much hope of enjoying it, much less being any good at it. I say that because I've struggled and indeed given up on other Paradox games, finding them intimidating, the learning curve too steep, decision paralysis etc. Somehow with CK3 Paradox has finally nailed the combination of deploying myriad extremely deep and complex mechanics, but making them (just) accessible enough to get into. It's like you can put your toe in the shallow end and gradually wade in until the game consumes you. I've also learned enough from my first playthrough of CK3 that I feel like now I can take another look at those other Paradox games I'd given up on (looking at you, EU4....) because I now feel like I understand much more of the fundamentals and meta-mechanics of a Paradox grand strategy game that I simply couldn't wrap my head around until CK3.

That is NOT to say CK3 is ""easy"" or ""simple"". Far from it...it's a deep and rewarding game that also manages to capture the 'just one more turn' addictiveness of the Civilization series despite it being real-time (with pause at will), not turn based. That is a massive hat-tip and compliment from me.

How does Paradox manage to bring the 'just one more turn' impulse to a real-time grand strategy game? Read on for the next category:

B - A medieval simulator: This game memorably recreates the sheer chaos and unpredictability of medieval history by simulating how the smallest event can set of a chain of instability that brings carefully laid plans to ruin...and then stunning reversals to reclaim glory from ashes.

The game gives life to the old saying 'for want of a nail, the Kingdom was lost...' because seemingly insignificant relationships, events, minor misdeeds can suddenly cascade into realm-wide catastrophe....but it's neither random nor ""unfair""...one can experience how everyday events had real-world consequences on a massive scale during this incredible period of history.

CK3 has done what no other Paradox game could...got me playing, enjoying it, and keeping on for 'just one more turn'...!",True,english

After spending a good amount of time with the game, I can say that while I like Crusader Kings III, I’ll never feel as excited about it as I was with its predecessor. The leap from CK2 to CK3 feels minor in terms of gameplay evolution — outside of the graphical improvements, the core mechanics haven’t been significantly expanded upon.

Unfortunately, the major issue that plagued CK2, namely repetitiveness, hasn't been adequately addressed. There are moments of brilliance, and it's still a fun game for those who enjoy grand strategy, but it lacks the depth and novelty to keep me as engaged as CK2 did over the years.

Whether or not you wanna bust your bawlz or attach pillows on everything, make the game as difficult or as easy as you'd like. There shouldn't be no wrong way to want to play the game. Still, between becoming a survival sim or John Rambo every zombie with a s&%t storm of bullets, the game is so very much worth the buy.

With a heavy focus on realism and player choice, this survival sandbox offers a deeply immersive experience that few other games can match. Whether you’re managing your character’s health, building your dream base, or evading hordes of undead, Project Zomboid keeps you on your toes at every moment. Having spent over 730 hours in the game, I can confidently say that it delivers one of the best survival experiences available today.

1. Realism Done Right
Despite the fictional backdrop of a zombie apocalypse, Project Zomboid nails realism in almost every aspect of gameplay. The most valuable tip for any new player is simply: ""What would you do in this situation?"" The game's health system is intricate, with injuries, illnesses, and mental states all playing a role. Clothes protect you from zombie bites, degrade over time, and help regulate body temperature, which is vital. Mechanics like repairing vehicles, dealing with character traits and professions, and managing inventory weight make everything feel real. I especially love how character emotions and moods affect gameplay – it’s small touches like these that elevate Project Zomboid to another level of immersion.

2. An Open World That Never Ends
The current game world is massive, and despite having played over 730 hours, I still didn't explore all the areas. I admire the sheer size of the map, and with upcoming updates promising to expand it further and even include randomly generated maps in the distant future. Project Zomboid also offers infinite gameplay and replayability. It’s one of those survival games you can play over and over without ever getting tired.

3. Sandbox Customization Options
One of my favorite aspects is the ability to tailor the world to your liking. From the number and behavior of zombies to loot distribution, characters (players), and more, Project Zomboid lets you tweak almost anything. It gives you the power to create a world that fits your personal playstyle or challenge yourself with tougher scenarios.

4. Character Creation and Professions
This is hands-down one of my favorite features in the game. Choosing different professions and character traits, both positive and negative, significantly changes how the game plays. I also appreciate the subtle bonuses and drawbacks that aren’t immediately obvious – it adds an extra layer of depth. The balance in this system is present, too, so don’t expect to create an overpowered character unless you tweak the sandbox settings to do so!

5. Community Mods
While Project Zomboid doesn’t need mods to be great, the fact that they’re available is a huge bonus. The modding community has added incredible content, from enhanced realism to new vehicles, traits, weapons, and crafting options. There’s too much to describe in one review! That said, I recommend playing without mods at first to truly grasp the game’s mechanics, but later on, mods can make the experience even better.

6. Skill Levels and Physical Attributes
Project Zomboid features an extensive skill system that allows players to improve their characters through practice and experience. Skills are divided into categories like combat, crafting, survival, and agility, each having a noticeable impact on gameplay. Combat skills such as aiming and reloading become crucial for firearm users, while melee skills like blunt and blade proficiency determine how effective you are with weapons like baseball bats or axes. Crafting skills, including carpentry, metalworking, and tailoring, let you fortify your base, repair clothes, or even create tools from scratch.
Survival skills like foraging and fishing allow you to live off the land when resources run dry, and farming lets you grow your own food, providing a sustainable source of nutrition. Agility skills, such as sneaking and lightfooted, are essential for staying hidden from zombies, while sprinting helps you escape when the situation gets dire.
Physical attributes like strength and fitness are equally important, as they directly affect how much weight you can carry, how fast you tire, and how effective you are in combat. Improving your strength means you can carry heavier loads and hit harder with melee attacks, while better fitness ensures you can run longer distances and recover faster from exhaustion. Each skill progresses the more you use it, making every action in the game feel meaningful and rewarding.

7. Intriguing (But Optional) Lore
While the storyline isn’t central to the player’s experience yet, it does exist, and it’s fascinating. I only started diving into the game’s lore after playing for about 500 hours, and once I did, I was hooked. I went so far as to read up on the game’s backstory online (beware of spoilers!) Exploring the lore adds a new dimension to the game. I highly recommend getting to know the lore yourself!

8. A Sandbox Experience
Want to build? Build. Want to destroy? Go ahead. In Project Zomboid, your creativity (and characters human possibilities) are your only limits. The only challenge is gathering materials, which makes sense given the post-apocalyptic setting. But with enough time and motivation, you can accomplish incredible things. This open-ended approach is perfect for players who enjoy creating and building their own worlds.

9. Active Developer Support
The game is still in early access, and while it may not be updated on a daily basis, the developers deliver large, meaningful updates. They listen to player feedback, fix bugs, and continue to improve the game without ignoring the community, which is something I greatly respect.

10. Hidden Depths
Just when you think you’ve learned everything there is to know about Project Zomboid, it surprises you. The game is full of hidden mechanics and features that add to the depth of the experience. I’ve had several moments where I thought I had mastered the game, only to discover a new layer of complexity. It’s a game that keeps on giving.

11. Fair Price
Finally, let’s talk about the price. For what Project Zomboid offers, the price is perfect. But if you’re looking to save a bit of money, it’s always worth waiting for a sale. Either way, you’re getting your money’s worth for this gem of a game.

Project Zomboid is a truly exceptional survival game that combines deep realism with sandbox freedom. Whether you're fighting off zombies, building your own fortress, or scavenging for supplies, every moment feels impactful. With continuous updates, an active modding community, and endless replayability, it’s a game that will keep you coming back for more. I can’t recommend it highly enough to fans of survival games or anyone looking for a challenging, immersive experience.",True,english

The game definitely feels like it doesn't respect your time with a fairly large map that takes awhile to move around in. Making things such as a minecart network feels like a hassle, since mine carts  / boats aren't equipped to your character, but placed on the rail network, so if you die, you'll have to walk all the way back to get your vehicle.  Fast travel points are few and far between, and the only way (As far as I know) to create an additional fast travel point is extremely resource intensive and has a TEN minute cooldown.

You'll also need a large amount of materials for a lot of stuff in the game, which the game seems to flirt with automating the process a bit by having automated drills to get these resources for you.  The way you can automate things is extremely basic however, and will require you to just randomly explore until you find an appropriate node you can place your drills at. 

The gearing for combat in this game also feels pretty basic, and doesn't have as much synergies as I'd like. For example, I equipped an armour set that increases crit chance upon poisoning an enemy. However I found that this trait doesn't proc when using a range weapon that poisons enemies, when using a character skill that inflicts poison whenever you deal damage, or when using a pet that poisons enemies. It seems to only proc when using a poison melee weapon - which wasn't mentioned in the description of the armour set. 

The breaking point for me in this game was [spoiler] A large underwater sea section, which you basically need a boat for traveling around at. There's a water boss in this section without a fast travel point near it. Dying to it not only means having to make the long trek back, but you'll either need to remake your really expensive boat or make a long land bridge back to your stuff[/spoiler]

Ultimately, I was looking for something to scratch my survival crafting itch, but there's not enough here to justify the massive grind.",False,english

The progression of this game is fantastic and the crafting system is easy to use/follow.  Go-karts, Boating, PvE, PVP, boss battles... I was never bored playing this game as there is always something to do.  The customization you are allowed to make in game is endless (painting, flooring, walls, farming, automation, mob spawning, etc.).  Essentially you need to defeat certain bosses to gather parts to power the core, which will unlock more of the available map.  There are also optional bosses, ALL of which have fun mechanics and I recommend trying all boss fights.  The appearance of the game to me was appealing, giving almost a retro feel to the game.  This game felt like it took great aspects from other games I've played and put it into one. 
 Very fun game, definitely recommend it.  

Things I've learned/tips:
1.)  Using the Map - to place the Icons, select the desired icon and click the middle mouse button on the map to add; click on same spot to remove.  Mark boss fighting/summoning locations to find easier later on.
2.)  If you want to customize flooring that doesn't allow it to be painted; put a ""glass floor"" on top of it, then paint it.  May find a color you like w/ that pattern.
3.)  Create Scanners to find bosses, sooo much more convenient than blindly running around the map.
4.)  Save the figurines you collect.  There's a way to ""power"" them to have them spawn that type of mob; they do not drop loot, though still grant exp for your skill ups.
5.)  You have 3 different gear sets, recommend binding those sets to hotkeys.  Some fights may be much easier if/when you switch armor sets/tactics during the fight.

Hope the above helps, enjoy!",True,english

Started with hard mode and it provided enough of a challenge to keep the game interesting. The game provides enough variety of activities to keep you exploring without tiring out from any one activity. When you get tired of fishing, for example, you move on to something else for a while. 

I'm not a min/max kind of player, so I do my own builds with whatever I find via natural play through and was able to find some of the legendary weapons in good time. Ranged weapons are very good in this game, especially physical ranged like the daggers. Overall, Armor sets favor physical melee and ranged builds. There are some for casters or summoners as well, but they aren't very strong end game and fall off fast. Mainly because there are only two books to summon creatures. At some point  the mana cost gets to be too high and the bats are too dumb for combat situations to really focus on summons and I found myself using daggers or other weapons like the fireball staff to compensate. I really really tried making a summoner build work on its own, but I couldn't get through some of the content even though I was geared fairly well. Switched to physical range and beat everything no problem. At the time of me writing this, I have only the remaining two titans left, which I'm about to tackle next.

I do feel like the game suffers from an identity crisis. Does it want to be an open world survival like Minecraft, something casual like Stardew Valley, or more of a Boss a Rush type of game?

The postive thing ia that you get a little bit of all 3, but the negative is that you have to deal with game mechanics that intentionally slow you down.

Example, Trying to farm Wool, but you can only do it every 10 real time minutes. Bosses that have a cooldown before they respawn. Or farming for the 3 upgrade materials, Emearld,Ruby, and Sapphire which take forever without a Mob spawner. 

If you can look past the obnoxious grind for materials, I think youll enjoy your stay here. Alot of these materials arent necessary until later in the game depending on how fast you push into the next zone.


Boss are cool. Lots of sets and diversities. The upgrade station allows all early gear to stay relevant if one choose to upgrade them. 

Looking forward to future updates. Hoping they remove uncessary bottlenecking or change them in a way that is less annoying. 

Example, Cattle should give the materials right away, Then go on a cooldown. Instead of feeding them, waiting 10 mintues then getting the item.",True,english

A Personal Journey into Peaceful Creativity:

From the moment I launched Tiny Glade, I felt as though I'd stepped into a serene oasis far removed from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Developed by the indie studio Pounce Light, this game isn't just about building structures—it's about building moments of peace and allowing your imagination to wander freely.


Visual Poetry in Motion:

The game's visuals are nothing short of enchanting. The hand-crafted art style feels warm and inviting, like flipping through the pages of a beautifully illustrated storybook. Each element, from the gently swaying trees to the softly glowing windows of a cottage, is rendered with such care that it’s impossible not to feel a sense of wonder. I often found myself pausing just to watch the way the sunlight filtered through the leaves or how the shadows danced across the rolling hills.


Embracing the Freedom to Create:

What sets Tiny Glade apart is its emphasis on unstructured creativity. There are no timers ticking down or resources to hoard—just an open canvas waiting for your touch. The grid-free building system felt incredibly liberating. I could effortlessly draw a winding stone wall that morphed seamlessly into a quaint archway or let a cobblestone path meander through a meadow without constraints.

At one point, I started constructing a small village nestled at the edge of a forest. As I added little details—a lantern here, a flowerbed there—the place began to feel alive. It was as if the game was encouraging me to tell my own story without uttering a single word.


An Auditory Hug:

The sound design is like a gentle hug for your ears. The soft rustle of leaves, distant bird songs, and the occasional whisper of the wind combined to create a soundscape that was both relaxing and rejuvenating. The music is subtle, never overpowering the experience, but always enhancing the mood.

Reflections on User Experience:

Navigating through Tiny Glade is a breeze. The intuitive controls allowed me to focus on creating rather than fumbling with mechanics. There was a moment when I accidentally erased a section of my build, and instead of feeling frustrated, I found that the game's forgiving nature turned it into an opportunity to try something new. It's rare to find a game that so seamlessly blends user-friendliness with depth.


The Joy of Unwinding:

In a world where games often demand so much from us—be it quick reflexes, strategic thinking, or constant vigilance—Tiny Glade is a welcome reprieve. It's a space where you can slow down, take a deep breath, and let your mind wander.


Final Thoughts:

Tiny Glade isn't just a game; it's an experience—a gentle reminder of the joy found in simplicity and creativity. It rekindles that childlike wonder we often lose along the way. Whether you're an avid gamer looking for something different or someone who simply wants a peaceful escape, Tiny Glade offers a sanctuary worth visiting.",True,english

The game is beautiful but not as innocent as it looks. The real fun is in giving yourself a task and then solving it. Sometimes it takes less than a minute and sometimes quite a few minutes. Tools seem rudimentary but you can do a lot with them if you know what you are doing. At the beginning you don't.

Some remarks:
- edge scrolling needed ASAP. All the city builders have it and I am trying to use it all the time. WASD is clumsy.
- save system is not intuitive at all. 
- smoke looks like a paper towel floating above the chimney. If you have several houses with chimneys it seems that they are having a toilet paper feast.

- bigger terrain
- sheep and ducks are nice but I do miss people; they would not have to do anything, just move around.

[i]I am a seasoned gamer, I played from A to Z, hundreds and even more hundreds of games since the '90, I know my games and am proud of it. I saw this game, a few days ago, thought it looked nice, relaxing; I saw it had a demo and that its full release wasn't far away. I got immediately hooked, Elden Ring style, but without the frustration and concentration factor, replaced with utter calmness, peace of mind.[/i]

[b]Review(?):[/b]
The game itself is as easy as formidable, it delivers in what it wants you to do and what you actually want to do.
I'm no architect, but I managed to create little scenarios that made me chuckle as I was astonished by how beautiful and cute everything looked; every time I am done and happy with the results of that session, I take screenshots.
You could include ""Background Creator"" in the game's tags, because they are so gorgeous and ""soft"" that it calms you just by looking at a picture of something you created, out of literally nothing.

-Having the possibility to play a demo is a major up: every game should give you this opportunity before buying.

-The price is.. great, I was afraid to find 30-40-50 euros at its release, but they stayed true to what the game is; it's easy to find games that cost double and triple of this one and aren't this memorable nowadays, so thank you for that.

-No crash has ever happened, not in the full release nor the demo. I locked it at 60fps, render scale at 1.1 having my pc's performance set quite low so to not make it work, practically at all. Increasing the render scale increases the impact on your pc by a lot, can't say why as I have quite good specs. Upping the render scale to ""just"" 2.0 squashes my fps to around 20, but I'm using my pc in, almost, sleep mode. If you have problems with performance, lower the render scale by 0.1 until you're happy, it will still look good.

-I've read some reviews that say how this game is lacking in content, that they played a couple dozen minutes and ""finished it"", to that I can just say that they aren't made for this kind of games and that would be ok if they would say so. Not recommending a game that isn't in your alley, and not specifying it, is in my opinion, wrong. You could play hundreds of hours and not get tired (please not consecutively); the content is in your head. I just put a window on corner of a tower-like square building, then I put a second, and a third, at the end I had a section of the tower converted into a 360° window, it all worked so good and naturally that I stopped and thought what a great job the devs made, because they did.

-Sometimes it's ""hard"" to start without nothing, but if you continue you'll be amazed by the results; the glades start with something already pre-built, to give you an idea and the daily ""challenge"" is great for a quick session where you continue something, I presume, they created for the occasion.

[b]Verdict:[/b]
A cute and relaxing building/city builder that gives you the reins to your imagination (in this context of course).
Enough content for as long as your imagination is fresh and trained, or you're willing to let go for a while and just click away; there's a start, but no end.
I am sure they'll add even more nice content, decorations, not for us to place individually, but seamlessly attack to what is around it (tables and chair on a flat roof for example), maybe more wall designs; I'm very confident they'll continue to work on it, and deliver.

It's a [b]9/10[/b] for me, it is just that beautiful and meets its promises like no other game lately.

Unlike one and two that had stronger story narratives and the building was more secondary: four has the same problem (or advantage depending on your preferred style of gameplay) as three in that the story narrative is hardly there although in four it is more apparent. 
They really made this version for players that enjoy treating it like a sandbox with some minor challenges. A lot of the challenges are very simple unless you're very much not used to that gameplay or just want to create as much chaos as possible. I would say this is much more like playing dollhouse but for adults (as someone who enjoyed playing dollhouse as a kid this is much more of a pro for me). Building, decorating, and creating narratives for your Sims is pretty much the gameplay.
The base game does enough if you want to scratch that itch for a little while, but if you love it and want to play often as a comfort game then you want to invest in some of the DLC. The DLC is the real money makers for the developers and some packs are great, some mid, and a few pretty terrible. Most aren't worth the initial price so wait for a seasonal sale. They usually have a couple sales throughout the year. If you're not sure about the pack then go on Youtube! Sims has a very large and dedicated fanbase! I do recommend lilsimsie since I find her reviews to be less biased and the community is more positive. I have yet to install mods in this version since I find most of the packs I've installed to be enough for me, but I would check out the mods for fun stuff for free. Altogether it can be a really fun game, but it is kind of niche. Also checkout the gallery for fun builds! Whenever I want inspiration then I checkout the community gallery and YT for help. Hope this helps!",True,english

This game is hard, like vary hard, if you are new you will die a lot to older players.  So here are a few things you can do to get better at the game.

1. Don't cheat.  You will not get better if you do cheat and you will make the game worse by doing so.
2. Listen to your surroundings.  This can make you win or loss a game just because you could not hear where the other players shots are coming from so you put your back towards the player shooting at you instead of facing them.
3. Do not land at popular sites, this is an easy and fast way to go back to the lobby, instead look for locations at least 1km from where the plane is flying and go there.
4. Play with friends and use VOIP.  You can use the in game VOIP, but what I use is Discord.
5. Don't go more then 100 m from your team mates.  This way when one of you is in trouble, 3 of your team mates are at positions to aid you.  Also don't be to close to each other, as this makes you easier to spot and makes it harder for you and your team mates to return fire when you are in a fire fight.
6. When you see someone, ping them so your team mates know where they are and can aid it taking them down.
7. Take a automatic weapon and a long range weapon (DMR or SR).  My suggestion for a new player is a SMG and a DMR.  For SMG use one of the 3, UMP, VECTOR, MP5K.  As for DMR's, use SLR or DRAGUNOV.
8. Carry at least 4 First Aid kits, 10 bandages, and 4 boosts.
9. Carry 2-3 Smoke grenades.
10. Just have fun.

Will change to a thumbs up once they've added new servers in hopefully this game continues to grow as I have high hopes for it!

UPDATE: Pretty disappointed at how the management is with this game as they try to do a lot of banning and not to mention banning stream snipers instead of focusing more time on actually trying to open new servers up so to get more exposure for the game.....Right now it's kind of a turn off so decided to uninstall it.

Takes everything from the first to a more grand scale. Abstracts away 'wood vs iron', for instance, in favor of factions and a council where laws are proposed and deals are made. Loving the gold accents in the menu and visuals. Soundtrack is gas. Yet these are only icing on the already delicious post-apocalyptic society-builder cake.

The game takes great strides to make things feel personal, as in how individuals in your society respond to events and feel.

I didn't play the first one, but heard much about it. So I'm not comparing it to anything, but to me this game is a masterclass in immersion and natural as well as guided storytelling. The mechanics are great and feel different from other games. It's original. The game doesn't hold your hand, the prologue serves as a tutorial, but doesn't feel like a tutorial: You're immediately fighting for survival, but the game never feels unfair. Here and there I wished the consequences of my actions were clearer, but you can always reload, and I suggest making multiple saves. I never got soft locked, but I'm sure you can.

You explore the world as you explore mechanics and the story unfolds. The story feels very authentically interlinked with what you do. When factions were mad at me, they had good reason to, and they all have reasonable stances, that just happen to conflict very often. Moral choices are nuanced.

You will be managing and balancing dozens of things at the same time, have to make sacrifices, sometimes heavy ones, but you always have clear and realistic short and long-term goals. Some self-imposed, some from the game's plot, and some just to keep your people alive and if possible, happy. For a city management game it's extremely exciting. Oftentimes I barely scraped by.

Other developers can learn from this. How to trust your audience: show them the basic with more show than tell, then throw them into the cold water and let them figure it out.

Special shout out to the the graphics and sound design. It's actually a very pretty game and I wish I could zoom in more (the zoom-in on generators doesn't do it for me).

Now that I finished the campaign I can't wait to play the sandbox mode, which seems pretty fleshed out with 7 starting locations and completely different factions from story mode.",True,english

They really improved it."" What the devs did with Frostpunk 2 is revamp the game to be almost a new game. 

You feel the constant pressure of your choices. Everything is on the brink of collapse as you try to balance the politics, failing machinery, and ever encroaching cold with resources that are few and far and between. This truly feels like a ""survival, post-apocalyptic setting"". You desperately need more food, you finally find some frozen food stores under the ice. So you go to build an extraction district to try and pull the resources out. Some of the workforce mining the coal out of the ice died from starvation or the frost. Now you do not have enough workers. So you pull from another area. Some of the children start to go feral as the city starts to descend into anarchy. The coal mine is not producing coal as it dries up, so your generator holding the cold barely at bay is running out of fuel now.  You make a deal with a colony for some of their oil to keep the heat on for a little longer. In doing so, one of the rising factions in the city begins to oppose you because they do not like the deal you made. 

Its a constant struggle of back and forth that makes you feel you are really on the precipice of extinction and about to go over. 
Game play is outstanding. Graphics and audio are great. Some audio sound bite loops (such as when you click on one of the factions) can get old fast. Minor nitpicking aside, this game is absolutely fantastic. No you do not need to buy the first game at all. This is well worth the 45 bucks to a somewhat small studio for game play that is infinitely better than any of the sludge the ""AAA"" studios will ever produce.",True,english

If there was a neutral rating I would give it. There is a good core of the game here, keeping much of the spirit of the first game.There is a good core of the game here, keeping much of the spirit of the first game.

Pros 
1 - Game looks great. Good atmosphere and art on the menus. Colors and well done to lean into the overall dystopia steam punk vibe. 

2 - More of a natural society progression. You don't just get to choose what society you'll be with a simple choice. Your laws, the factions you favor and your choices in events grow your society. This leads to tech and law unlocks. Makes for a fun RP experience and something refreshing to see in a city builder.

3 - Most of the core mechanics of the first game are intact, so resources and heat management especially are still very much the priority.  

4 - Game still has a great soundtrack and atmosphere all around.

Neutral 

1 -  It's on a larger scale than the first game so you don't build individual buildings, you just build districts. Your ascetic control of your colony is basically non-existent. For me this is irksome, but this really comes down to a personal preference. I miss being able to craft my colony to look a certain way. But this is purely an ascetic issue and I can't knock the game for it. 

Cons 

1 - This game should have an early access tag. It has several small bugs that can really just kill your run. You'll spend some amount of time online trying to figure out what happened until you realize it's a bug.
                - Example - First scenario in new london, you establish a colony for oil. My progress just stopped even with ample frost teams. I paused all other outpots to get more frost teams, that did not restart progress. When I sent people to establish the colony, it reduce the number of works in all my buildings in new london. This caused me to have less frost teams. Even after increasing worker count, my colony would not progress in building. Had to reload. Seems like a minor bug, but annoying because if you don't catch it right away it can kill your run.


2 - QoL is poor. Resource management is an integral part of this game. Everything is a slider when it comes to resources, being workers or raw materials. Some you can get precise numbers on because the slider also has small button allowing 1 quantity changes. Others do not have this option, because reasons. So you sometimes have exact control over how many workers are somewhere, or how many resources you send/receive. Other times you just get to throw a handful of workers at a new colony and hope it's close enough to the number you want. Also you can't scroll with arrow key, or middle mouse with the sliders either. Just click and hold. You also can't cancel buildings in progress, and if you lay a building down wrong have to just deal with it later. You also while planning to build, can only cancel in sequential order. Can't click on a tile to cancel just one and build somewhere else. Minor issue but again, just more lifting for the user for seemingly no reason. 

3 - UI is bad, like all form over function bad. You can hotkey to most important things, which is fine. You can also hover over your resources and most of the numbers up top to see a better breakdown. But the idea to have the 5 categories hang below your top UI not really be intractable at all is baffling to me. The worse they get, the longer the tail they get, which can end up cluttering the top of your screen. You also get zero information about them. Some are derived stats, some are all ready covered in your resource needs. They feel redundant and don't serve much purpose beyond the look. You also cannot short cut most actions in a district. It has an empty building slot? Well can't click on the building slot to do anything. Have to exit looking at the district, go to your buildings build menu which is different from your district build menu, find the right sub category for the building you want, then select it. Seems like a minor gripe but like...you can't build any of the buildings outside of their specific district type besides heat ones. Why do they need their own menu, why can they not be done from the district menu? They're upgrades, not independent items. Game becomes more dependent on pause with small things like this.

The population count is higher, there are more resource/types, you can create and maintain more than one city/settlement during a run, and the faction system is dynamic. I do miss the small scale of Frostpunk 1 at times. Starting off with a handful of settlers and watching them trudge throw snow and ice, some freezing to death, in a desperate effort to collect enough coal and other resources to survive.

The change in scale from the original, as others have pointed out, makes things a bit less impactful. I find myself going, ""well, that's the cost of doing business"" way too much.
However, my biggest issue is that, despite the delayed release, the game really could've benefited from another few months in the oven to polish off some of the more obvious bugs. For example, I've encountered a few weird UI glitches. That's to say nothing of the day-1 patch ""temporary fix"" for what is a pretty jarring audio crackling issue in big cities. It's not a good look to release it like this.

Please, developers, and I mean all game developers, not just 11-Bit Studios: Polish off your games. People will forgive less obvious bugs, but when you release a game with glaring issues that *had* to have been apparent prior to release, it's really bad form. Day-1 patches for these kinds of issues don't really mitigate the optics, in my book. Day-1 patches say to me, ""we know the game isn't finished, but we're releasing it anyway.""

In conclusion, this is a tentative ""not recommended"" from me, purely on the grounds of it being released without solving the aforementioned obvious bugs. I'm confident these issues will be fixed soon, but the game being released in this state leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",False,english

It does feel like a natural progression from Frostpunk 1, in terms of scale. In both games, resource management is important and have far-reaching consequences if you do not manage it well. I do agree with some reviews that in Frostpunk 2, you don't feel as attached to the individuals when compared to Frostpunk 1. People, at least to a degree, are just numbers. But I did enjoy the statements from individual characters in the game in general. However, when I finished the main story, I wouldn't help but wonder if I did my best, or whether I did the right thing. All I could say was an attempt was made. I would argue there was an emotional attachment involved in Frostpunk 2, but not to the individual. Rather, I felt more attached to the city itself. Achieving that isn't easy and I do applaud 11-Bit Studios for taking a risk here. The game did do a good job at making things feel desperate near the end but I do admit, the music wasn't as noticeable for some reason.

The mechanics have been refined and expanded, making the game even more immersive. My first campaign was a wild ride, and I loved it.

I started as Duchess Matilda of Tuscany, and things quickly went out of control. After committing the ""crime"" of fornication, I had to deal with the consequences not once, but twice: first, when the child was born, and then when someone blackmailed me to reveal the father’s identity. I refused. My liege, Kaiser Heinrich IV of the Holy Roman Empire, decided to arrest me twice, ruining my reputation and legitimacy. To make matters worse, he revoked some of my titles, reducing me from a Duchess to a Countess.

I plotted an assassination scheme against the Kaiser, and to my surprise, it worked. With a new liege, I set my sights on recovering my lost titles. I declared war on my Duke and, after a tense battle, managed to reclaim two of them. While I didn't get back all of my original titles (I went from 6 down to 4), it was still a lot of fun.

A - Playability - Paradox have finally found the sweet spot between complexity and accessibility. I did not come to CK3 with much hope of enjoying it, much less being any good at it. I say that because I've struggled and indeed given up on other Paradox games, finding them intimidating, the learning curve too steep, decision paralysis etc. Somehow with CK3 Paradox has finally nailed the combination of deploying myriad extremely deep and complex mechanics, but making them (just) accessible enough to get into. It's like you can put your toe in the shallow end and gradually wade in until the game consumes you. I've also learned enough from my first playthrough of CK3 that I feel like now I can take another look at those other Paradox games I'd given up on (looking at you, EU4....) because I now feel like I understand much more of the fundamentals and meta-mechanics of a Paradox grand strategy game that I simply couldn't wrap my head around until CK3.

That is NOT to say CK3 is ""easy"" or ""simple"". Far from it...it's a deep and rewarding game that also manages to capture the 'just one more turn' addictiveness of the Civilization series despite it being real-time (with pause at will), not turn based. That is a massive hat-tip and compliment from me.

How does Paradox manage to bring the 'just one more turn' impulse to a real-time grand strategy game? Read on for the next category:

B - A medieval simulator: This game memorably recreates the sheer chaos and unpredictability of medieval history by simulating how the smallest event can set of a chain of instability that brings carefully laid plans to ruin...and then stunning reversals to reclaim glory from ashes.

The game gives life to the old saying 'for want of a nail, the Kingdom was lost...' because seemingly insignificant relationships, events, minor misdeeds can suddenly cascade into realm-wide catastrophe....but it's neither random nor ""unfair""...one can experience how everyday events had real-world consequences on a massive scale during this incredible period of history.

CK3 has done what no other Paradox game could...got me playing, enjoying it, and keeping on for 'just one more turn'...!",True,english

After spending a good amount of time with the game, I can say that while I like Crusader Kings III, I’ll never feel as excited about it as I was with its predecessor. The leap from CK2 to CK3 feels minor in terms of gameplay evolution — outside of the graphical improvements, the core mechanics haven’t been significantly expanded upon.

Unfortunately, the major issue that plagued CK2, namely repetitiveness, hasn't been adequately addressed. There are moments of brilliance, and it's still a fun game for those who enjoy grand strategy, but it lacks the depth and novelty to keep me as engaged as CK2 did over the years.

If you’re new to the series, CK3 is a solid place to start. But for veterans of CK2, the experience may feel more familiar than fresh.",True,english

The journey of the game was different from most franchises since in some respects, each Warhammer can be considered one big DLC. I say this as a positive, because it makes the world massive and gives a great of variety of different play throughs. 

The meat of the game isn't the campaign(s), it's ""Immortal Empires"" the game mode that brings all games together. However I do hope one day they do make a final campaign or even a game mode where it's the forces of ""good"" vs ""Evil"" working together.

Persona 3 considering its the oldest of the three (story wise) it feels like a breath of fresh air as i feel both persona 4 and 5 kinda follow the same kind of trend. Especially when it comes to the cast i feel as when it comes to the *best friend character* in persona games he's pretty stock standard. However, when it came to persona 3 Junpei felt like an actual realistic best friend, sure he still likes you as a friend but I like the fact there were many times in the story where he was extremely jealous of the mc, and then the way they tackled his meaning for living was very well done easily making Junpei one of my favourite characters in the game. 

The story was extremely good with many highs and many lows for the cast I'd honestly love to see a game that follows a similar path to persona 3 rather than 4 or 5, (not to say i dont like 4 or 5).

The only complaint i had is tartarus often felt quite repetitive and most the bosses just seemed almost like filler bosses.

I give this a 9/10 very good would recommend :D",True,english

I was really surprised when they announced a remake of Persona 3, as I had never played the original. So, this was technically my first time seeing the game in a 3D environment.

While the remake lacks the Female Protagonist from P3P, as many people have pointed out, which does make me sad, I do somewhat understand why she was ultimately scrapped. Even though she's not included, I still think this game is worth buying, as it made me cry even more than the P3P version ( which was a lot ), despite already knowing what would happen in the story.

The new features added to the remake, such as Shifting and the Linked Episodes—especially for Shinjiro and Ryoji—are a very welcome change. The new Strega scenes also help give the group more importance and plot significance. Overall, I'm so glad this remake came out, and I can't wait to see what's next for the Persona series. Whether it's Persona 6 or another remake, we'll just have to wait and see.",True,english

The game definitely feels like it doesn't respect your time with a fairly large map that takes awhile to move around in. Making things such as a minecart network feels like a hassle, since mine carts  / boats aren't equipped to your character, but placed on the rail network, so if you die, you'll have to walk all the way back to get your vehicle.  Fast travel points are few and far between, and the only way (As far as I know) to create an additional fast travel point is extremely resource intensive and has a TEN minute cooldown.

You'll also need a large amount of materials for a lot of stuff in the game, which the game seems to flirt with automating the process a bit by having automated drills to get these resources for you.  The way you can automate things is extremely basic however, and will require you to just randomly explore until you find an appropriate node you can place your drills at. 

The gearing for combat in this game also feels pretty basic, and doesn't have as much synergies as I'd like. For example, I equipped an armour set that increases crit chance upon poisoning an enemy. However I found that this trait doesn't proc when using a range weapon that poisons enemies, when using a character skill that inflicts poison whenever you deal damage, or when using a pet that poisons enemies. It seems to only proc when using a poison melee weapon - which wasn't mentioned in the description of the armour set. 

The breaking point for me in this game was [spoiler] A large underwater sea section, which you basically need a boat for traveling around at. There's a water boss in this section without a fast travel point near it. Dying to it not only means having to make the long trek back, but you'll either need to remake your really expensive boat or make a long land bridge back to your stuff[/spoiler]

Ultimately, I was looking for something to scratch my survival crafting itch, but there's not enough here to justify the massive grind.",False,english

The progression of this game is fantastic and the crafting system is easy to use/follow.  Go-karts, Boating, PvE, PVP, boss battles... I was never bored playing this game as there is always something to do.  The customization you are allowed to make in game is endless (painting, flooring, walls, farming, automation, mob spawning, etc.).  Essentially you need to defeat certain bosses to gather parts to power the core, which will unlock more of the available map.  There are also optional bosses, ALL of which have fun mechanics and I recommend trying all boss fights.  The appearance of the game to me was appealing, giving almost a retro feel to the game.  This game felt like it took great aspects from other games I've played and put it into one. 
 Very fun game, definitely recommend it.  

Things I've learned/tips:
1.)  Using the Map - to place the Icons, select the desired icon and click the middle mouse button on the map to add; click on same spot to remove.  Mark boss fighting/summoning locations to find easier later on.
2.)  If you want to customize flooring that doesn't allow it to be painted; put a ""glass floor"" on top of it, then paint it.  May find a color you like w/ that pattern.
3.)  Create Scanners to find bosses, sooo much more convenient than blindly running around the map.
4.)  Save the figurines you collect.  There's a way to ""power"" them to have them spawn that type of mob; they do not drop loot, though still grant exp for your skill ups.
5.)  You have 3 different gear sets, recommend binding those sets to hotkeys.  Some fights may be much easier if/when you switch armor sets/tactics during the fight.

Hope the above helps, enjoy!",True,english

Started with hard mode and it provided enough of a challenge to keep the game interesting. The game provides enough variety of activities to keep you exploring without tiring out from any one activity. When you get tired of fishing, for example, you move on to something else for a while. 

I'm not a min/max kind of player, so I do my own builds with whatever I find via natural play through and was able to find some of the legendary weapons in good time. Ranged weapons are very good in this game, especially physical ranged like the daggers. Overall, Armor sets favor physical melee and ranged builds. There are some for casters or summoners as well, but they aren't very strong end game and fall off fast. Mainly because there are only two books to summon creatures. At some point  the mana cost gets to be too high and the bats are too dumb for combat situations to really focus on summons and I found myself using daggers or other weapons like the fireball staff to compensate. I really really tried making a summoner build work on its own, but I couldn't get through some of the content even though I was geared fairly well. Switched to physical range and beat everything no problem. At the time of me writing this, I have only the remaining two titans left, which I'm about to tackle next. 

Good game and definitely worth playing. Can't wait to see what else they'll add. Hoping that summoners get some more love",True,english

I do feel like the game suffers from an identity crisis. Does it want to be an open world survival like Minecraft, something casual like Stardew Valley, or more of a Boss a Rush type of game?

The postive thing ia that you get a little bit of all 3, but the negative is that you have to deal with game mechanics that intentionally slow you down.

Example, Trying to farm Wool, but you can only do it every 10 real time minutes. Bosses that have a cooldown before they respawn. Or farming for the 3 upgrade materials, Emearld,Ruby, and Sapphire which take forever without a Mob spawner. 

If you can look past the obnoxious grind for materials, I think youll enjoy your stay here. Alot of these materials arent necessary until later in the game depending on how fast you push into the next zone.


Boss are cool. Lots of sets and diversities. The upgrade station allows all early gear to stay relevant if one choose to upgrade them. 

Looking forward to future updates. Hoping they remove uncessary bottlenecking or change them in a way that is less annoying. 

Example, Cattle should give the materials right away, Then go on a cooldown. Instead of feeding them, waiting 10 mintues then getting the item.",True,english

A Personal Journey into Peaceful Creativity:

From the moment I launched Tiny Glade, I felt as though I'd stepped into a serene oasis far removed from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Developed by the indie studio Pounce Light, this game isn't just about building structures—it's about building moments of peace and allowing your imagination to wander freely.


Visual Poetry in Motion:

The game's visuals are nothing short of enchanting. The hand-crafted art style feels warm and inviting, like flipping through the pages of a beautifully illustrated storybook. Each element, from the gently swaying trees to the softly glowing windows of a cottage, is rendered with such care that it’s impossible not to feel a sense of wonder. I often found myself pausing just to watch the way the sunlight filtered through the leaves or how the shadows danced across the rolling hills.


Embracing the Freedom to Create:

What sets Tiny Glade apart is its emphasis on unstructured creativity. There are no timers ticking down or resources to hoard—just an open canvas waiting for your touch. The grid-free building system felt incredibly liberating. I could effortlessly draw a winding stone wall that morphed seamlessly into a quaint archway or let a cobblestone path meander through a meadow without constraints.

At one point, I started constructing a small village nestled at the edge of a forest. As I added little details—a lantern here, a flowerbed there—the place began to feel alive. It was as if the game was encouraging me to tell my own story without uttering a single word.


An Auditory Hug:

The sound design is like a gentle hug for your ears. The soft rustle of leaves, distant bird songs, and the occasional whisper of the wind combined to create a soundscape that was both relaxing and rejuvenating. The music is subtle, never overpowering the experience, but always enhancing the mood.

Reflections on User Experience:

Navigating through Tiny Glade is a breeze. The intuitive controls allowed me to focus on creating rather than fumbling with mechanics. There was a moment when I accidentally erased a section of my build, and instead of feeling frustrated, I found that the game's forgiving nature turned it into an opportunity to try something new. It's rare to find a game that so seamlessly blends user-friendliness with depth.


The Joy of Unwinding:

In a world where games often demand so much from us—be it quick reflexes, strategic thinking, or constant vigilance—Tiny Glade is a welcome reprieve. It's a space where you can slow down, take a deep breath, and let your mind wander.


Final Thoughts:

Tiny Glade isn't just a game; it's an experience—a gentle reminder of the joy found in simplicity and creativity. It rekindles that childlike wonder we often lose along the way. Whether you're an avid gamer looking for something different or someone who simply wants a peaceful escape, Tiny Glade offers a sanctuary worth visiting.",True,english

The game is beautiful but not as innocent as it looks. The real fun is in giving yourself a task and then solving it. Sometimes it takes less than a minute and sometimes quite a few minutes. Tools seem rudimentary but you can do a lot with them if you know what you are doing. At the beginning you don't.

Some remarks:
- edge scrolling needed ASAP. All the city builders have it and I am trying to use it all the time. WASD is clumsy.
- save system is not intuitive at all. 
- smoke looks like a paper towel floating above the chimney. If you have several houses with chimneys it seems that they are having a toilet paper feast. 

For the future:
- bigger terrain
- sheep and ducks are nice but I do miss people; they would not have to do anything, just move around.

[i]I am a seasoned gamer, I played from A to Z, hundreds and even more hundreds of games since the '90, I know my games and am proud of it. I saw this game, a few days ago, thought it looked nice, relaxing; I saw it had a demo and that its full release wasn't far away. I got immediately hooked, Elden Ring style, but without the frustration and concentration factor, replaced with utter calmness, peace of mind.[/i]

[b]Review(?):[/b]
The game itself is as easy as formidable, it delivers in what it wants you to do and what you actually want to do.
I'm no architect, but I managed to create little scenarios that made me chuckle as I was astonished by how beautiful and cute everything looked; every time I am done and happy with the results of that session, I take screenshots.
You could include ""Background Creator"" in the game's tags, because they are so gorgeous and ""soft"" that it calms you just by looking at a picture of something you created, out of literally nothing.

-Having the possibility to play a demo is a major up: every game should give you this opportunity before buying.

-The price is.. great, I was afraid to find 30-40-50 euros at its release, but they stayed true to what the game is; it's easy to find games that cost double and triple of this one and aren't this memorable nowadays, so thank you for that.

-No crash has ever happened, not in the full release nor the demo. I locked it at 60fps, render scale at 1.1 having my pc's performance set quite low so to not make it work, practically at all. Increasing the render scale increases the impact on your pc by a lot, can't say why as I have quite good specs. Upping the render scale to ""just"" 2.0 squashes my fps to around 20, but I'm using my pc in, almost, sleep mode. If you have problems with performance, lower the render scale by 0.1 until you're happy, it will still look good.

-I've read some reviews that say how this game is lacking in content, that they played a couple dozen minutes and ""finished it"", to that I can just say that they aren't made for this kind of games and that would be ok if they would say so. Not recommending a game that isn't in your alley, and not specifying it, is in my opinion, wrong. You could play hundreds of hours and not get tired (please not consecutively); the content is in your head. I just put a window on corner of a tower-like square building, then I put a second, and a third, at the end I had a section of the tower converted into a 360° window, it all worked so good and naturally that I stopped and thought what a great job the devs made, because they did.

-Sometimes it's ""hard"" to start without nothing, but if you continue you'll be amazed by the results; the glades start with something already pre-built, to give you an idea and the daily ""challenge"" is great for a quick session where you continue something, I presume, they created for the occasion.

[b]Verdict:[/b]
A cute and relaxing building/city builder that gives you the reins to your imagination (in this context of course).
Enough content for as long as your imagination is fresh and trained, or you're willing to let go for a while and just click away; there's a start, but no end.
I am sure they'll add even more nice content, decorations, not for us to place individually, but seamlessly attack to what is around it (tables and chair on a flat roof for example), maybe more wall designs; I'm very confident they'll continue to work on it, and deliver.

It's a [b]9/10[/b] for me, it is just that beautiful and meets its promises like no other game lately.

Unlike one and two that had stronger story narratives and the building was more secondary: four has the same problem (or advantage depending on your preferred style of gameplay) as three in that the story narrative is hardly there although in four it is more apparent. 
They really made this version for players that enjoy treating it like a sandbox with some minor challenges. A lot of the challenges are very simple unless you're very much not used to that gameplay or just want to create as much chaos as possible. I would say this is much more like playing dollhouse but for adults (as someone who enjoyed playing dollhouse as a kid this is much more of a pro for me). Building, decorating, and creating narratives for your Sims is pretty much the gameplay.
The base game does enough if you want to scratch that itch for a little while, but if you love it and want to play often as a comfort game then you want to invest in some of the DLC. The DLC is the real money makers for the developers and some packs are great, some mid, and a few pretty terrible. Most aren't worth the initial price so wait for a seasonal sale. They usually have a couple sales throughout the year. If you're not sure about the pack then go on Youtube! Sims has a very large and dedicated fanbase! I do recommend lilsimsie since I find her reviews to be less biased and the community is more positive. I have yet to install mods in this version since I find most of the packs I've installed to be enough for me, but I would check out the mods for fun stuff for free. Altogether it can be a really fun game, but it is kind of niche. Also checkout the gallery for fun builds! Whenever I want inspiration then I checkout the community gallery and YT for help. Hope this helps!",True,english

7/10 if I wanna be critical

I'd say this game is great if you just focus on the main parts of the game and just enjoy your time with what you have.
However, if you want to play stuff that isn't included stock... well, your wallet definitely won't be thanking you any time soon.

The music is pretty good, I'd say for every, ""Meh, it's okay,"" you'll have two, ""Dang, that's pretty good."" But to get that ""WOW"" feeling, you better cough up some of your precious dollars. This is because the songs that come with the game seem almost specifically designed to be a level or two below the paid content; not enough to really upset you, but just enough to sort of bug you. This will inevitably lead to you buying at least one of the DLC that you simply don't need. All of that knocks off a good chunk of the out-of-ten score.

If you're okay with spending money on what is, admittedly, a decent variety of songs (even if it's an objectively bad deal), then you'll have a really good experience. It's not just the songs that are better; the mapping is, too. The maps in the base-game are alright, but most of them lack a certain level of enjoyment. The DLC maps fix that, in my opinion, bringing the count of really good or enjoyable maps from 1 in 5 to 1 in 3 (or even 1 in 2). The DLC is definitely high quality from what I've seen.

But don't fret over that high price-tag as I once did. There are plenty of sales throughout each year to really enable your addiction to spending, with packs plummeting from around $30 (CAD) to just $7; sometimes, the prices can get even lower than that, so keep an eye out.

It would be great if there was a way to set the difficulty for songs played by selecting random in Freestyle. From what I'm understanding, currently it just sets the randomly selected song to a random difficulty, meaning that occasionally I get a really hard or SC song which I'm still working my up to right now. Also, being able to queue songs after each other in Freestyle would be very nice, or maybe even a continuous mode similar to AIR but for Freestyle (i.e which keeps your scores properly). Speaking of AIR, I would really like to be able to mark a song as favourite once I've done it in AIR so that I can easily find it in Freeplay.",True,english

Every penny spent on it is worth the experience. One of the first things that impressed me was how unique and distinct each theme is, with every theme having its own background music when selecting modes. Each chart has its own music video, and if it doesn’t, the game creates an original one, clearly showing the level of care and investment from the developers.

The game is frequently updated, not only adding new songs but also introducing more difficulty levels to older charts. The game features four modes: 4B, 5B, 6B, and 8B. If you want to ""get good,"" you should play every mode, starting from 4B, then progressing to 6B, and so on.

In terms of value, if you're lucky enough to buy the game and its DLCs during a sale, it’s a steal. I was able to get the full game at 80% off.

My only minor complaint is that the game doesn’t have many collaborations with other major rhythm games. While Chunithm and Muse Dash are included, I’d love to see DJMAX RESPECT V collaborate with games like maimai or SDVX and feature more Japanese artists. However, I have to admit that the game already offers a diverse range of music for everyone. I’m not a big fan of K-pop, but DJMAX changed my mind. I got to know more lesser-known Korean artists like TAK, KATOMORI, and XeoN, and I must say, I’m really addicted to their music.

The game immerses you in a way that few can, combining its gripping story, breathtaking visuals, and impeccable soundtrack to pull you into the dystopian Night City. There were countless times where I would just stop to look around and take in the gorgeous views.

I found the blend of FPS and RPG elements to be very fun and engaging. Building up V's strength throughout the game was particularly satisfying for me, particularly in how it can interplay with the narrative, even if on the smaller side. Difficulty wise I thought it was pretty balanced overall. It does get on the easier side of things from mid to late game but I don't mind that at all. The game is limited to first person, which I didn't mind after awhile. It's an FPS after all. 
Overall, I loved the high octane, high stakes approach it takes to its combat.

I did not play this game when it first launched, so I have no idea what issues from release still remain. I can however report on the problems I did find regularly:
- Poor LOD Rendering
There were many times, particularly after installing the Phantom Liberty DLC, where the game's engine struggled a lot with loading LODs properly. I mainly noticed it with the NPCs and vehicles, especially when driving, where they would load at very low detail until you're like a few steps away. Rarely when driving, the road can just unload for some reason and become invisible for a couple seconds, which can really screw with you. This is pretty uncommon though.
- Low Traffic Density While Driving
When you're not driving around the city, the traffic is pretty normal. However, once you start going at high speeds on the road, traffic seems to diminish significantly. This does create an uncanny result considering its supposed to be a mega city. It seems the game does this to further save on resources, but it is still somewhat distracting how little traffic there can be.
- Vehicle Summoning
The game allows you to call your vehicle, and it will drive itself to you. Even to this day, the menu for this still says the feature is in beta. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any plans to properly finish it. Now, I bring this up because a lot of the time, the place that it chooses to spawn your car is..not great. Sometimes it will spawn on another road that's like a block away, and other times it spawns it in other vehicles. But on occasion, the car may straight up spawn in the air, where you can watch it gracefully tumble all the way to the ground. Other than traditional fast travel, cars and motorcycles are the de facto way to get around Night City, so a feature like this should probably have had more time in the oven.

Despite those recurring issues I had, they are nowhere near game breaking. They only hurt the already amazing immersion a bit. I did not really experience any crashes before installing mods, so those issues seem to be gone. In all, I definitely think the game is in a good place now. If you were thinking about getting Cyberpunk for yourself, I highly recommend it.",True,english

All the RPG elements you'd expect, fully voiced, great post-release maintenance/commitment and in a truly interesting non-fanstasy setting. The mechanics don't really mirror Cyberpunk 2020 or Cyberpunk: RED TTRPGs; while unfortunate, the mechanics in this game are solid.

And best of all, the game very moddable with a vibrant, engaged, and productive mod community.

Only disappointing aspect was that it has no 3rd person. You cannot see the character of the story, you cannot see their cool moves and action. Rather it's like you, the player at the computer, is there rather than the character of the story. And it wasn't immediately apparent how this weakens the whole experience.

But other than that there are only two minor points of weakness, both addressable in the mature product:
1. Boss fights assume certain style of play--the dev's preference. This is solvable by mods.
2. CDPR having their favorite story ending and putting weak effort into other endings because you should have thought like the devs and writers to get the best endgame experience [see Witcher 3]. This is solvable by research and then playing the fleshed out single ending CDPR envisioned.

Everything else is top notch, engaging, and fun. Has all the RPG elements you'd expect and good quests, decent story lines. DLC is lacking, but they did release one at least--it's also very decent; almost more interesting than the main storyline [again, see Witcher 3].

The World of Cyberpunk 2077 is a dark and gritty one. A dystopian but but also real future where you're either rich or barely surviving. but what makes this game beautiful is, despite it all, you keep fighting for a better life, never fully loosing hope even at your lowest of lows. the game shows this with not only your character but also the supporting cast. Characters who often seem hard and tuff like the city has forced them to be opening up to you and being vurnurable to you as you get to know them. Judy, Panam, heck even Johnny Silverhand. all characters who I will remember and cherish.

Now as to the gameplay when this game first came out it was, and I pardon my language, Dogshit... But ever since the 2.0 update they overhauled everything and somehow did a complete 180! With the gunplay going from feeling unimpactful and bland to OOMPHY in the best way possible and then the upgrade system acually feeling worth it with new abilities and customization to make truly unique and fun builds all of which are viable! I personaly love fully upgrading reflexes allowing me to dash and dodge around both on ground and mid-air for some really fun almost bullethell like movement or going for a more stealth build allowing you to quickly take out enemy bases and finish gigs with a quick swipe reall assassin style! just a few of the many ways to play the game and I can practically garantee that there is a playstyle for you! So much fun.

The music is also amazing and somethign I wanna highlight as a producer myself. It really perfected what Cyberpunk should sound like. It's drone like nature with these elements of punk music really fusing together in such a unique way! It just has this tensity to it that just feels suspenseful. Then there's the action music which I swear I would be so much stealthier if it didn't go as hard as it goes cuz DAMN it makes me pumped! It's so intense and adrenaline filled and fits so well to every senario! truly spectacular.
but the best tracks in the game for me are the more quiet ones. the ones that play in somber or joyful moments. the themes of the characters you meet. Johnnys theme using a cello/violin making it sound like a guitar somehow is just beautiful and really shows another side of johnny in a way. and leidmotives of ""never fade away"" (a song by Johnnys band) playing at just the right times making it almost a theme of sorts for the events that it plays in. I dunno It just adds so much to the imersion and I can't get enough of it.

And don't even get me started on the DLC. Phantom Liberty is one of the best expansions I have ever played. The district of Dogtown is dense and full of fun activities to do, but once again the highlights are the characters. Somehow they're even deeper than before, feeling like acual people who all have unique motives and personalities that when it came time to choose I couldn't decide cuz I cared so much for all of them. I wanted the best for all of them but due to the nature of the story (which i won't spoil) I could'nt and it was heartbreaking, but it also felt beautiful in a way. Just absolutly phenomenal story telling and a story I will never forget.

In the end I would personally highly recommend this game. It's a game I always come back to replay, a world that I can't get enough of and one of those games that gave me something I'll keep for the rest of my life. It might take some time to get into but trust me once ur in it will be an experience you will never forget. an experience that, despite it's dark nature, made me feel hope. A thing of beauty for sure.

and a thing of beauty will never fade away...

1091500,Cyberpunk 2077,RPG,https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1091500/header.jpg?t=1726188854,"9 Dec, 2020",CDN$ 39.99,"Cyberpunk 2077 is an action-rpg set in a future where corporations a locked in a struggle for domination over the scraps of the old world left behind by cataclysmic wars, Rogue AIs and a captured, decadent, and complicit populace.
The main story is staged in Night City, an open-world sandbox with a mix of neo-noir and ganster movie characters and narratives. While the DLC's is significantly smaller in scope, it's a tight, well written spy thriller that keeps some of the same beats (the heist elements) but remains fresh with new stakes and an interesting cast.
The RPG is well implemented: in addition to ""cyberware"" -interchangeable parts that influence your controls, movements patterns, weapon affinity and some gameplay interactions, you have 3 main variables that make for very deep character building: Attributes, Perks and Skills.
You have 5 main Attributes- each Attributes will have its own ""Perk"" tree. Raising an Attribute (up to a max of 20) will unlock more (and better) Perks. Attributes mostly have an influence on weapon proficiency and some interactions, but will also impact how you approach certain missions. Will you break the door? Can you hack the door? Can you stay hidden or will you ram through? The 3D environment of Night City helps you tackle situations with a wide variety of possible solutions.
While the ""Attributes"" can only be reset once per game, the Perks can be refunded and distributed again as many times as you wish outside combat, encouraging experimentation. You can see which weapons work best for you, how your perks interact with each other and your cybernetic implants.
The Skills progress naturally- anytime you perform an action, take down an enemy with a certain weapon, pass a dialogue or Attribute check- the related Skill will increase. Up to a max of 50, every 5 levels you will unlock a permanent boost.

I think the main downside to the game is how long it is- not all missions are created equal and sometimes it's a drag or a bit of a bore, but those moments are few and sandwiched between thrilling combat sequence. Didn't particularly care for the DB elements either.

Overall 9/10, the few narrative lapses or repetitive nature of some missions didn't spoil my fun enough to bring the score lower than that. I would just add that the soundtrack is a constant banger and is very serviceable to the story.",True,english

I could probably go on. Graphics a decent I really enjoyed the still screen moments. and like I said the storys were well done and had me encrosed. but I like playing side quest and taking my time with storys.

Some of the payouts are pennies, and some are much bigger, but the idea that you might hit big or miss out on the next great item or event keeps you hooked.

There’s a lot of flash and bang, action-packed gore to keep things interesting, and plenty of ways to build your character.

Since then I've enjoyed it, despite the battle pass, which only has cosmetic rewards.  I still don't love the idea of a battle pass but the fact that the battle pass is purely cosmetic helps water it down for me.  Another thing that helps greatly is that the free tier of armor looks really amazing.  They didn't skimp on armor cosmetics to try and guide people towards buying cosmetics, which is a big plus and actually the only reason I would recommend the game.

amazing.
a few bad bosses, nothing a avg person cant manage.
needs to work on the progression of the game, I feel like I cant wear a armor set that's actually cool because you unlock a new craft every 1-2 hours and most of the time they are way better than what ever armor set you crafted before that. 
the combat is great and I feel like there is a lot of build variety especially when you get some of the mythical staffs. 
the game is long and great. ~50 hours for me to beat 6 chapters, and get the true ending so :)...

probably going to buy the dlc when ever it comes out, which is very soon actually because the base game was supposed to have like 11 chapters and most of the chapters had most of the design done",True,english

After finally folding and purchasing the base game at a discount, I quickly grew to love the combat system, methods of gaining power, and especially the story the game told. The most important part of any game to me is the story, followed by the combat mechanics, then the graphics. Cyberpunk smashed all my expectations so much so that I purchased Phantom Liberty at full price when I was halfway through the game, solely because I knew I wanted more content before the end of the game. I'm very glad I did. The DLC has been wonderful, and without spoiling it, I would rate it 2 tiers above the base game (7/10 - base, 9/10 DlC, for an average of 8/10). Note that 5/10 simply means ""average"" and reasonable for the experience/price. I fully recommend the DLC if you enjoyed the base game.",True,english

1. For some reason, when the chase starts and you get hit by a car and continue driving, we did not continue. Our car got pushed to the gate and didn't move. I had to restart.
2. Then when you start fighting scavs, it's needlessly hard. It's my 2nd playthrough, on hard difficulty. On hard, I killed Adam Smasher on 2nd try at just lvl 35 with sucky cyberware, and I'd say Adam Smasher is one of the hardest bosses in the game. This thing took me 5 tries. My advice -- when you get out of car, you get blades. Forget the blades, get back to pistol, find cover and be very careful as they'll shred you very quickly. Be careful with skulls and netrunners. First time I got killed by a runner.
3. After finally doing this, I go to the ""wounded scav"" and... nothing happens. It's bugged again. Trust me, I tried everything and I don't think I did anything unusual to cause it. 

At this point I just lost it. Come on, The DLC had been out for a year now, and the base game is 4 years old at this point. I understand that making games of this scale is hard. Even after 4 years, in the base game content, I still encounter some small bugs but I'm like ""okay, no biggie"". But this is just not acceptable quality.",False,english

The dlc is its own thing pretty much with an extra ending of its own, which has the added benefit of skipping the remainder of the core vidya.

Now, onto the good things: the script, the pacing, the dialogues, the execution of a properly polished thriller. The DLC adds some extra missions for old fixers. Fetch quests aside, the quest are good too, adding depth and nuance to the NPCs. Though the most important is the selection of end-game choices you're presented with. Between wetwork, dubious loyalties and complex motivations of dramatis personaes, someone did their homework on intelligence services so a lot of it offers a very authentic experience. A lot of times you leave feeling dirty - because that is the nature of the work. My only criticism is you couldn't off Meyers (it'd be tons of fun, I think), but otherwise it's next to excellent. Johnny's dialogue at the end of the lunar escape was a rare gem, diverging from his usual abrasive rants. Meeting Mr Hands in person was somewhat of a letdown, but more gigs from the sphinxian villain was welcome.

It's difficult to believe the DLC was produced by the same studio as the cliché and filth-filled dumpster fire that is the core game. The setting remains as disgusting as ever, with humanity locked in a dull and primitive state of neo-feudal corporate overlords or communes of plain-roaming barbarians, but Phantom Liberty redeems the price tag. If you find a way to skip to the DLC and just play the extra, do it: it is a real treat for any lovers of a spy drama - something Deux Ex tried and failed to do.

Edit: ending credits animation film was an outstanding tribute to the classic James Bond movies. Stellar.",True,english

Imagine if James Bond, Keanu Reeves, and Idris Elba decided to throw a party in Night City, and you get to clean up the mess. That’s Phantom Liberty for you.

The expansion kicks off with the President of the New United States crash-landing in Dogtown. Yes, you read that right. Apparently, Air Force One now comes with a “crash here for plot development” button. You’re hired to rescue her, but not before you navigate through a maze of cybernetic baddies, morally ambiguous choices, and enough plot twists to make a pretzel jealous.

Idris Elba’s character, Solomon Reed, is the secret agent we all wish we could be. He’s suave, he’s mysterious, and he probably has a better skincare routine than you. Meanwhile, Keanu Reeves returns as Johnny Silverhand, still rocking that “I hate the system” vibe but with a touch more existential dread. It’s like watching your cool uncle go through a mid-life crisis, but with more explosions.

Dogtown itself is a marvel. It’s like someone took all the worst parts of a dystopian future and decided to make it a tourist attraction. The local wildlife includes cyber-enhanced gangsters and vending machines that might just try to sell you a grenade. But hey, at least the street food is to die for—literally.

The gameplay is a rollercoaster of emotions. One moment you’re making life-or-death decisions, the next you’re wondering why your character’s pants have suddenly disappeared. It’s all part of the Cyberpunk experience, folks. Embrace the chaos.

In conclusion, Phantom Liberty is the perfect blend of high-stakes drama, cybernetic mayhem, and unintentional comedy. It’s like a soap opera set in a dystopian future, and honestly, we wouldn’t have it any other way. So, grab your cyberdeck, put on your best trench coat, and dive into the madness. Just watch out for those vending machines.",True,english

When [b]Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (LADIW)[/b] first trailer came out, I was really looking forward to coming back to the turn-based JRPG gameplay that the game was going for. I was really excited to what the game improved on with [b]Y7[/b] and what new features that the game had in store for it. With that said, this review will also be a bit hard for me to cover in certain aspects, as I don’t want to spoil anything on the game.

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*]A very interestingly crafted story with fun characters
[*]Fun turn-based gameplay
[*]Unique jobs that can give you a variety of moves
[*]Lots of side content to do in the game
[*]Fantastic soundtrack that is nice to listen to
[*]Beautiful graphics that make the areas feel alive
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]The story loses some of its charm near the end
[*]New Game+ and other difficulties locked behind a DLC
[/list]

[h1]Story[/h1]
[b]Ichiban Kasuga[/b] was working at an average job until he one day gets let go from his and cancled by a [b[Vtuber[/b] on in one day. This is due to a callout video made by a [b]Vtuber[/b] named [b]Hisoka Tatara[/b] and because of this [b]Kasuga[/b], with his two friends, [b]Nanba and Adachi[/b], decide to go to the [b]Seiryu clan[/b], to find answers. Along their way, they meet ex-yakuza members and meet [b]Jo Sawashiro[/b], who then tells [b]Kasuga[/b] to go to [b]Hawill[/b] and find his mother. Although there is a lot more going on then one may seem.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3333939084
The story for [b]LADIW[/b] is pretty good, I really loved the new characters and the returning ones were also nice. I honesty think even telling one of my favorite characters is spoiling the story too much, besides [b]Tomizawa[/b], who is a cab driver and was just a cool character. The story has that classic crime drama that the series is known for.

However, the story does lose some of its charm near the end of the game, as it falls off a tad bit although this is only a minor issue that I noticed. Everything else with the story is great but near the end, it kind of just goes away, although they do leave off with an interesting note for it’s next game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[b]LADIW’s[/b] gameplay mainly remains the same from the previous entry but there are some changes that I really loved that the game added. Besides [b]Kasuga[/b], everyone will now pick up objects to attack people if they are near them. So if you ever wanted to see [b]Nanba[/b] throw a bike at someone, well now you can. You can also use MP to cast special moves to deal more damage, buff/debuff someone, or heal. Overall, the gameplay is very fun and your characters can learn lots of moves to help them in combat.

During combat, you can also time the enemy's attacks so you can block them to do less damage. One of the newest things to combat for enemies is that they can be in a guard state, when they are in this, they will take reduced damage. To get them out of the guard state mainly, you have to use a grab attack, in which they will be taken out of that state. Your teammates also have a radius on their attacks, they can attack any enemy at any range but if they stay in the radius, they will do extra damage on that attack.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3333941765
Jobs are back as well and there are some unique ones that are with each party member. This time around, all the jobs in this game are very good and there isn’t one that is bad necessarily. However, there are some jobs that are ok for the most part but aren’t bad, it is up to personal preference but I never really came across a bad job in this game for any character. Especially [b]Joongi Han or Seonhee[/b] where their main jobs were just straight up broken.

If you want to switch jobs but keep a certain move, you can do it with a move transfer feature that the game has. Which is very useful to create the ultimate character with the best job with some of the best moves in another job. Although you can only do up to five moves in total completely. So make sure you have the moves that you want to use and keep note of them so you can make the most of them.

There is a ton of side content that the game has in it and some very interesting ones at that. The first one I would like to bring up is [b]Sujimon[/b], which is this game's version of [b]Pokemon[/b], where you battle [b]Sujimon[/b] trainers and challenge gym leaders. Then there is [b]Dondoko Island[/b], where you manage a hotel resort, it’s like [b]Animal Crossing[/b] to an extent. So as you can see, You have three games in one, [b]Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, Pokemon, and Animal Crossing[/b]. There is a lot to the gameplay that I have not explained but I can’t fit it all into this review, I do talk a little more about this game in my video on it (will be out soon, ran into some problems}. I also rated all the [b]Yakuza[/b] games that I have played so if you are interested in that, keep an eye out for it.

Although despite having all of this great stuff in this game, [b]Infinite Wealth[/b] has one glaring issue with its gameplay or the game as a whole. New Game+, is locked behind a DLC and so is hard mode, in other words, you only have access to one difficulty for the game. The game isn’t that hard either but the fact that a basic game feature is locked behind a DLC just proves [b]Sega’s[/b] greed.

[h1]Graphics, Performance and Soundtrack[/h1]
The graphics for this game are beautiful and I loved how the world that you are in is detailed, each area felt real and it’s like I was in its world. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM, I had no issues while I was playing and I was able to play it just fine, on medium settings.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3333942218
The soundtrack for this game is just fantastic and it even rivals Y0’s soundtrack, my favorite songs in the game are [b]Camouflage, Barracuda, and Giftiger Füllhalter[/b]. These songs just sound so damn nice to listen to and I highly recommend you check them out when given the chance.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
[b]Infinite Wealth[/b] is one of the best games that I have played this year and I am glad I was able to experience it in all its glory. I recommend this game to all [b]Yakuza[/b] fans, especially for those who enjoyed [b]Y7[/b]. You will have a great time with this game and the side content will make sure you are hooked and are playing the game for hours on end.

Three words that fit this game perfectly. There is nothing more infuriating then trying to get on with a game's story just to be thrown into a forced animal crossing bootleg tutorial. The game's story (when it isn't extremely predictable or being hindered by endless filler) is pretty good and I want to see more of it, so it's a shame that you have to trudge through sneaking through crowded streets of enemies for an hour to get to it. It got to the point where I just had to go on WeMod and turn on stealth mode. This game could have been great, but since the seventh entry they've really dropped the ball with the franchise.
Also Ichiban is not a good character. Having a character obnoxiously looking for the good in horrid people doesn't make him a good guy, it makes him stupid, and no matter how hard you try to push this ""him and Kiryu are so alike"" point it will never make it true. ",False,english

At a whopping 127 hours by Steam playtime, Infinite Wealth is now the longest game I've ever played by a huge margin. It took me nearly 40 hours longer than its predecessor, and over 30 hours longer than it took to earn a platinum trophy in Persona 5 Royal. Whatever else you want to say about this game, you can't say that you're not getting your money's worth. The bigger question is whether this incredible level of time investment is worth it. Although this is in many ways a great game, it's harder than I'd like to say that it was 127 hours well spent. 

Let's start with the good news. The main story is well done, and you could probably get through it in a relatively normal amount of time for a JRPG if you're focused on it. It has some fun fights and a lot of callbacks that I'm sure are exciting and rewarding content if you've played Yakuza 0-6. The new characters are deeply integrated into the plot and have satisfying arcs. Honolulu is a fun city to explore and feels as different from Ijincho as you'd expect.

A lot of the other things that were good in the last game remain fun. The battle system is still great, and made more so by new jobs. The music is great. There are some entertaining side quests, the minigames are gloriously stupid, and so on. You'd expect at least a few things that are horribly underdeveloped in a game this long, but everything is basically fine at a minimum. 

The bad news is that while nothing truly feels incomplete, many parts of the game would have benefited from more refinement. Although the minigames are fun, there are only a handful of new ones and there's nothing as crazy as kart racing or running a public company from the last game. Most of them, like the parodies of Crazy Taxi and Pokemon Snap are solid experiences that run out of new content after 20 minutes and don't have worthwhile rewards. The highlights are supposed to be Donodoko Island and Sujimon battling, which parody Animal Crossing and Pokemon respectively, but neither of them have the depth to reach their full potential. Dondoko island boils down to spamming buildings all over your island until you get the next cutscene, and Sujimon battling is almost entirely determined by who has the best rarity Sujimon at the highest level. Since each Sujimon only has one move and all moves do pretty much the same thing with different damage totals, there's little reason to anything other than mash A and occasionally swap for type matchups. You need to complete Dondoko Island and the Sujimon league if you want to complete all the quests, but they're each long enough that you could have finished an entirely different game instead. That was one thing in the last game when the minigames were as fun as many other full games, but in this case it really didn't feel worth the time. 

Sadly, the minigames aren't the only place where you get the feeling that the devs didn't get all the time they needed. The story rushes to make sure every major character returns, but several of them clearly have no reason to be back and barely play any role other than being present. The final battles at the end of the game are well made and difficult, but the evil monologues you're treated to reveal that the villains never really had any kind of coherent plan, which makes you wonder what the point of it all was and whether there was supposed to be more content that would have tied everything together better. It's all capped off by one of the main party characters not even being present for the epilogue and instead just getting a single sentence to explain what happened. It's not quite ""and then everybody died, the end"", but it's hard to imagine an explanation other than not having time to make another epilogue cutscene. 

At the end of the day, Infinite Wealth is a great game that just tries to do too much. RGG wanted to have a sendoff for Kiryu while also telling a new story on the scale of the last game, and they really should have picked one or the other. Although they do a better job of integrating those two very disparate goals than you might expect, trying to cram all of that into a game with anything resembling a normal runtime just means that nothing gets the time it deserved. It's still a good game, but I can't help but wonder if it would have been better as two separate games that each had a single goal. If nothing else, that would have prevented the need to break the cast up into two small parties and given you more flexibility to build your battle team.

I know some fans of the Yakuza series have criticized parts of this game's story, and understandably so, but this game more than makes up for it. Hawaii as a setting for Ichiban and his pals works so well it seems like they've always been there. Every single part of the map is blooming with beautiful sights to see, and fun things to do. From the main story, to the side quests, to the many alternate game modes, this game never stops entertaining you. The story for this game is it's most divisive part, and for me it was my favorite part. I was an orphan myself, and the fact that a huge portion of Ichiban's story in this game was getting to see his birth-mother again was a beautiful thing that every adopted child wishes they could do. The scenes with Ichiban reminiscing on his family and what could have been felt like things that have gone through my head a hundred times. Kiryu's story was also somber. With our favorite dragon now having cancer, he can't fight like he used to. He learns to rely on his friends, which is a lesson everybody needs to learn eventually. The finale for both of these incredible characters fit perfectly within their themes, and it ends in an extremely satisfying way. The new characters are also fantastic. Chitose, Tomizawa, and Yamai are all realistic characters with interesting backstories and they fit right in with all of our favorites. The combat here is also a massive step-up from Yakuza 7. We now have movement options within the fights, which make planning and executing your moves that much more strategic. Add in an insane number of jobs, and you have a combat system that's fun all the way through. This game has so much to offer to so many different types of people, and that's why the Yakuza franchise is so incredible. Please play this game. You won't regret it.",True,english

Although unlike Dark Souls parrying is basically required just like Sekiro except the timing is a bit harder. Although I am a Souls veteran, I struggled immensely on the first somewhat challenging boss because it was pretty much a test of how well you could parry as simply whiff punishing between his attacks did very little damage. So parrying was the only way to get big damage by breaking his posture and riposting him. Once you master that, you've ""gotten good"" at LoP. There is also the rally system from Bloodborne, which just lets you regain most of the damage taken from blocking if you attack the opponent a few times after. The overall game has the same amount of polish as FromSoftware games, though it has a surprising amount of DNA from Code Vein in the sound and visual effects, and some mechanics like sliding down ladders and interacting with more things at your home base.

The first part of this review is for the general game, the second part is the threshold where I accepted it wasn't worth continuing.

Pros:
1.  The Legion arm mechanic is pretty cool.  Essentially preset secondary equipments that can be upgraded to add new passives to them.  Examples include a staggering grapple hook, a charge up electric blast, a landmine summoner, and a a retaliatory shield.  Legion arms allow you to get a boost against harder foes that your weapon proves insufficient for.
2.  Parry mechanics.  Depending on what kind of enemy your fighting, a perfect parry will either help stagger them for a combo hit or help shatter their weapon, reducing attack variety and damage.
3.  Specters act as boss assists if you're frustrated or unable to defeat a boss.  It's a pretty big help if your too frustrated.

Cons:
1.  Underwhelming soundtrack.  The only music in the game outside of the gramophone is against bosses, and they all sound pretty similar.
2.  Finite resources.  There's only one copy of each weapon, armor, and amulet, with no way to get more.  If you sold or missed an item, it's gone forever, the entire playthrough.  Quartz, the skilltree material, can't even cover half the skilltree without running out for the rest of the playthrough.  Cranks, allowing you to tinker with weapon scaling, are also finite, discouraging experimentation.  Consumables have to be slowly grinded for until chapter 5 when you can buy them.
3.  Rushed choices.  Any time the game has you make a narrative choice, it gives you about 6 seconds before automatically selecting whatever your cursor touched last, leaving no time to think anything through.  This leads to decisions feeling incoherent and shallow.
4.  Lack of information.  The game doesn't tell you what three of your six stats even do, making the early game confusing.  Status effects only tell you what they do once they've killed you.

Last part of my review is unfairness.  Up until Elysian Boulevard, the game does quite well with dying being your fault rather than cheap shots or instant death.  Once you reach the boss there, you have your first instance of simply full on stun locking you with no escape method.  Once you trudge your way through that, you soon hit the swamp monster, with the ability to also kill you in one inescapable combo, but with the addition of being far too durable to kill with consumables and shredding your specter.  Outside of bosses, several things lead to being unfair.  Several points have enemy locations that you can't reasonably deal with, leading to barely avoidable damage.

Keep in mind that this is my first souls like, so I can't compare it well to others.  I do enjoy difficult games such as Dead Cells and Celeste, but difficult and unfair are rather different things.",False,english

This game compared to most Souls-like games has given the most care out of any games I have seen. Not many games give an equal fairness into their mechanics besides this one. Every other souls-like game I have played has never given me much satisfaction compared to this one either. The story, the combat, the variety of combat weapons, and the goddamn level design and setting of the game just comes out as one of my Top 10 games of all time.

I own Elden Ring, but I never completed it because I got too lost in its open-world concept. However, this game was an amazing introduction to the genre, especially considering it comes from a smaller studio, not a massive corporation.

The story is captivating, and the game does a great job guiding you through it. The voice acting is absolutely incredible—most games have at least a bit of cringe in their dialogue, but not this one. The performances are top-notch.

Combat is really fun and rewarding. Parrying can break enemies' weapons, and you can combine different weapons and handles (I mostly used boss weapons throughout the game). I didn’t find the game overly difficult either—you can even beat some bosses with throwable items, and certain bosses allow you to summon an aid, which is super helpful.

The music is also insane. It’s one of the highlights of the game for sure. After beating it, I immediately wanted to start another playthrough, but I’ve heard that DLC and a sequel have been announced, so I’m waiting for that. When the DLC drops, I’m definitely doing another run with a new weapon setup.

If you’ve never played a Souls game, I really believe this is a great entry point into the genre. I highly recommend it!",True,english

Great story. Mostly great game. 3 of the bosses try hard to ruin it.

Given the fact that this is a game built almost entirely on parrying, it's frustrating when you can't stop a chain of actions to parry or dodge. Also any hit seems to slightly stagger P. For a split second you can't move and for just slightly longer you can't parry or dodge. Not a problem for most of the game, but for the very fast bosses chaining attacks, it's annoying you can see P not reacting to your input as another attack comes in. Yet for the most part, your attacks don't have the same effect.

There are minor issues with it such as bosses that jump very high in the air, yet the camera angle cannot look straight up. In some places it's like ledges are covered in grease. It's possible to be pinned against a wall or object by an enemy and have no way out, it's effectively a death sentence with certain enemies.

*Minor spoilers*
Most of the bosses are fun with good cut scenes.
3 of them are not fun. The King of Puppets, Laxasia and the Nameless puppet.
There is clearly a reason the achievement % drops off at each of these.
The times I beat them, it was luck of the draw of how aggressive the boss was feeling that round.

Sometimes it feels like that game goes out of it's way to kill you if you do ""too well"" and get close to killing the boss quickly in the first few rounds. You'll soon be punished with an onslaught. Yet if you just stand there and practice parrying, you don't get the same intense beating.

For the fights with the spectre, for me just using a single HP re-gen wish on it worked well to keep the boss distracted for longer. Other wishes are okay, but nowhere near as impactful as simply having two of you in the battle for longer.

Save throwing items until you have the boss down to <10% health, then use them to help finish it quick. Otherwise don't bother using them, they're effectively a limited resource before you'll have to go out farming for them. 

I beat each of the above 3 by using fable arts and throwables in those last few moments.",True,english

Lies of P sees you lead as Gepetto's puppet in a twisted, gloomy take on the folktale of Pinocchio. Waking up in an eerie train station, you soon make your way outside to the city of Krat, where a sudden trigger in the puppets causes a haunting massacre that sets the tone for the rest of the game.

     On that note, atmosphere is the name. Hotel Krat is your central hub, and it quickly evolved from being a brief trip to level up my weapons into a safe retreat where I could listen to a vibrant soundtrack in the background as I spoke with the many charismatic faces that made up this iconic location. It's not just the hub area - everything from oil-lined streets to infested cathedrals, the immense amount of detail present within the level design itself across most of the chapters is incredibly impressive. Whether it was my first playthrough or my sixth, I could not help but immerse myself in all of the intricately placed bodies & texts around the city that truly cements this game as an all-time example of how to do proper environmental storytelling within linear experiences. Neowiz and Round8 really wear the inspiration on their sleeves with the worldbuilding here and it's very well executed. (Note: it runs flawlessly for me on an upper-end rig, but even on my steam deck it is the best performing game I own. It's also very nicely balanced and well-paced. I would say I preferred the difficulty around launch, as it really heightened my enjoyment of this game in a unique way because of how challenging it was. But it's still a decent challenge and NG+ definitely brought that difficulty back.) 

     Combat is really where Lies of P hits all of its strides for me. As a fan of FromSoftware's 'soulsborne' entries for the better part of a decade, I believe Lies of P implements so many positive spins on their formula that I would recommend this over the traditional souls games to any player, regardless of experience (well... maybe play Sekiro.) For example, one of my favorite mechanics is pulse recharge, which allows you to gain one more charge to your healing consumable if you are at zero. This feature would change the entire dynamic of so many of my fights in an instant. Maybe I'm playing defensively, I've got two more heals and 60% of the boss's health left; in scenarios like this, every single time I reached zero heals, my brain would switch to aggression immediately in the hopes of regaining a charge and feel more 'comfortable.' I cannot speak to everyone's experience, but this mechanic made me a better player over time as I was PUSHED into being more active in my gameplay and subsequently rewarded with the most satisfying sound effect I've heard since the Halo CE shield recharge as a single pulse cell materializes right back into your upper belt. 

     Another great feature to the combat sandbox is the ability to assemble weapons. This is the single-most innovative design choice that Lies of P offers. Every weapon comes in two distinct parts, the blade tip and the handle. Each part has their respective stats; however, you can alter the handle to scale off of different stats than the ones it drops with. This opens up a lot of customization and encourages player experimentation, because at no extra-cost, your entire moveset and ability options can change in a matter of seconds. I myself am a Guts sword girl through and through, but even I felt compelled to experiment and eventually beat the game with my own ridiculous combinations. (Note: For me, this self-expression was VERY important in my enjoyment of the game, and I think it's a great innovation to the souls combat formula to allow your players to test out ANY weapon handle's moveset with... every other weapon's blade. Admittedly boss weapons are restricted from being customized and the scaling of both parts' stab/slash stat means that your options for good damage are inherently limited, but it offers so much freedom regardless that I would not mind seeing it return in the sequel.) 

     Story is the point I want to end this off on. For as long as I have cherished Bloodborne's lore, the original trilogy's lore, etc. I have never actually felt connected to the events of the stories presented in souls-like games. There's always been a strange disconnect for me being able to enjoy the challenge of the gameplay rather than caring about the story. I can say Lies of P genuinely moved me in a way no other games in this subgenre have. I believe the most obvious explanation for this is the greater emphasis on dialogue and player onboarding that Lies of P engages in. There is a real sense here with the amount of dialogue you'll receive from a character off-screen during gameplay or in the middle of a boss fight that Neowiz really wanted to make players feel INVOLVED in the big character moments as they are happening, rather than reading about them from a lore description (which is also a method of storytelling present with a lot to read up on that is engaging.) To be clear, I have no issue with this, but I really prefer the focus on character engaging with me, the truths/lies you decide to tell them, and the almost-immediate consequences those decisions can have as they relay their reactions back to you. You can ignore or fight multiple bosses by making a simple decision. I like that. The narrative throughline that is happening above all of the character stories is decently executed, but the character quests is really where Lies of P shines (shoutout to Arlecchino.) Everyone is voice acted phenomenally, and this could not be a Lies of P review without making mention of how pivotal this game's original soundtrack is to the overall experience. The music feels tied to the characters' stories, as many records you can play back at Hotel Krat are received from quest completions. This makes even something as seemingly trivial as playing a record on a record player feel rewarding in itself, as you learn more about an NPC's journey through this world or simply enjoy a great tune in the background. 

     This has become my comfort game, and affectionately so. That doesn't mean it is devoid of things I disliked, as the final area of the game, Arche Abbey, has got to be the single-most tedious level I have played in recent memory. Running through this moody grey wasteland to a grey tower with grey floors and repeated enemies from throughout the entire game got tiring incredibly fast, and it's a shame that the area with this game's pinnacle challenges is also so uninspired in its design. Additionally, I do not think the armor system, dubbed ""Defense parts,"" is particularly exciting. I think this could be fleshed out a little more, but finding more parts throughout the game is almost never exciting because they are always going to be better than your previous find, and they do not change any part of your puppet's appearance. I do like the cosmetics available here, but I definitely prefer the more free-form style of armor expression in other souls-likes. The legion arm system is probably the most disappointing aspect for me, delivering options to customize your limb similar to the prosthetic tools in Sekiro. I do not like the implementation in this game because it feels stiff to me. This is not something I have the knowledge to explain away, but it feels very restricted and with the low amount of legion I always have, it just left a lot to be desired for me because I mainly relied on parrying and counterattacking. 

     Despite my negatives, I adore this game. At the time of writing I have unlocked everything pre-DLC and waiting in anticipation for it as well as the recently announced sequel. If you've ever got a weekend to knockout a surprisingly compelling souls-like, this is absolutely the one for you.",True,english

Combat is fast-paced and has a bit of a learning curve, but is extremely satisfying once it clicks. Learning when to parry vs block, attack with a weapon vs throwbacks vs weapon art was fun and engaging. 

It also looks great and runs smoothly. Even on the Steam Deck with decent graphic settings, I was easily keeping 60 FPS.

Some people have criticized it for not being as open world as a game like Elden Ring, but I see that as a positive aspect of Lies of P. Being able to have a more linear path made the gameplay tight and paced well. It also never felt like it overstayed it's welcome, like I wind up feeling about many open world games.

The mechanics have been refined and expanded, making the game even more immersive. My first campaign was a wild ride, and I loved it.

I started as Duchess Matilda of Tuscany, and things quickly went out of control. After committing the ""crime"" of fornication, I had to deal with the consequences not once, but twice: first, when the child was born, and then when someone blackmailed me to reveal the father’s identity. I refused. My liege, Kaiser Heinrich IV of the Holy Roman Empire, decided to arrest me twice, ruining my reputation and legitimacy. To make matters worse, he revoked some of my titles, reducing me from a Duchess to a Countess.

I plotted an assassination scheme against the Kaiser, and to my surprise, it worked. With a new liege, I set my sights on recovering my lost titles. I declared war on my Duke and, after a tense battle, managed to reclaim two of them. While I didn't get back all of my original titles (I went from 6 down to 4), it was still a lot of fun.

By the end of Matilda's life, she held 10 titles. It was an unexpected journey, but that’s what makes the game so enjoyable, you never quite know where things will end up.",True,english

(My total playing hours are over 100 by the way but started on a different clock).

The reasons are in two categories, (a) the unexpected playability factor and (b) the medieval simulator factor.

A - Playability - Paradox have finally found the sweet spot between complexity and accessibility. I did not come to CK3 with much hope of enjoying it, much less being any good at it. I say that because I've struggled and indeed given up on other Paradox games, finding them intimidating, the learning curve too steep, decision paralysis etc. Somehow with CK3 Paradox has finally nailed the combination of deploying myriad extremely deep and complex mechanics, but making them (just) accessible enough to get into. It's like you can put your toe in the shallow end and gradually wade in until the game consumes you. I've also learned enough from my first playthrough of CK3 that I feel like now I can take another look at those other Paradox games I'd given up on (looking at you, EU4....) because I now feel like I understand much more of the fundamentals and meta-mechanics of a Paradox grand strategy game that I simply couldn't wrap my head around until CK3.

That is NOT to say CK3 is ""easy"" or ""simple"". Far from it...it's a deep and rewarding game that also manages to capture the 'just one more turn' addictiveness of the Civilization series despite it being real-time (with pause at will), not turn based. That is a massive hat-tip and compliment from me.

How does Paradox manage to bring the 'just one more turn' impulse to a real-time grand strategy game? Read on for the next category:

B - A medieval simulator: This game memorably recreates the sheer chaos and unpredictability of medieval history by simulating how the smallest event can set of a chain of instability that brings carefully laid plans to ruin...and then stunning reversals to reclaim glory from ashes.

The game gives life to the old saying 'for want of a nail, the Kingdom was lost...' because seemingly insignificant relationships, events, minor misdeeds can suddenly cascade into realm-wide catastrophe....but it's neither random nor ""unfair""...one can experience how everyday events had real-world consequences on a massive scale during this incredible period of history.

CK3 has done what no other Paradox game could...got me playing, enjoying it, and keeping on for 'just one more turn'...!",True,english

After spending a good amount of time with the game, I can say that while I like Crusader Kings III, I’ll never feel as excited about it as I was with its predecessor.

Unfortunately, the major issue that plagued CK2, namely repetitiveness, hasn't been adequately addressed. There are moments of brilliance, and it's still a fun game for those who enjoy grand strategy, but it lacks the depth and novelty to keep me as engaged as CK2 did over the years.

This game is hard, like vary hard, if you are new you will die a lot to older players.  So here are a few things you can do to get better at the game.

1. Don't cheat.  You will not get better if you do cheat and you will make the game worse by doing so.
2. Listen to your surroundings.  This can make you win or loss a game just because you could not hear where the other players shots are coming from so you put your back towards the player shooting at you instead of facing them.
3. Do not land at popular sites, this is an easy and fast way to go back to the lobby, instead look for locations at least 1km from where the plane is flying and go there.
4. Play with friends and use VOIP.  You can use the in game VOIP, but what I use is Discord.
5. Don't go more then 100 m from your team mates.  This way when one of you is in trouble, 3 of your team mates are at positions to aid you.  Also don't be to close to each other, as this makes you easier to spot and makes it harder for you and your team mates to return fire when you are in a fire fight.
6. When you see someone, ping them so your team mates know where they are and can aid it taking them down.
7. Take a automatic weapon and a long range weapon (DMR or SR).  My suggestion for a new player is a SMG and a DMR.  For SMG use one of the 3, UMP, VECTOR, MP5K.  As for DMR's, use SLR or DRAGUNOV.
8. Carry at least 4 First Aid kits, 10 bandages, and 4 boosts.
9. Carry 2-3 Smoke grenades.
10. Just have fun.

Will change to a thumbs up once they've added new servers in hopefully this game continues to grow as I have high hopes for it!

UPDATE: Pretty disappointed at how the management is with this game as they try to do a lot of banning and not to mention banning stream snipers instead of focusing more time on actually trying to open new servers up so to get more exposure for the game.....Right now it's kind of a turn off so decided to uninstall it.

UPDATE 2: The good news is that other servers are up but unfortunately it's leaving players wants to support that are in the Oceania region super dead clearly the devs should be more transparent about this so now they just seem to avoid the question all together........",False,english

EA FC 25 has become much more than just a football simulation game—it’s an obsession for many, almost to the point of addiction. The game’s allure lies not only in its realistic gameplay but in the psychological hooks embedded within its most popular mode, Ultimate Team. Here, players build their dream squads by purchasing and opening virtual packs, hoping to land high-rated players. The randomness of the pack openings, combined with the constant updates of new content and challenges, can feel like a never-ending cycle, which easily mirrors the addictive behaviors seen in gambling. Spending real money on virtual packs in EA FC 25 often feels like buying lottery tickets, with the dopamine rush from landing a rare player driving players to keep spending, hoping for better results next time. This practice has been widely criticized for promoting gambling habits, particularly among younger players, who might not fully grasp the financial consequences.

Personally, EA FC 25 triggers a unique frustration. Despite investing hours into perfecting skills, tweaking formations, and optimizing my Ultimate Team, the game often feels unfair. Matches can be decided by tiny, sometimes random moments—an AI glitch, a poor refereeing decision, or a lucky bounce—leaving me feeling powerless. What makes it worse is when the players you worked so hard (or spent so much) to acquire seem to underperform, leading to pure rage. The gameplay mechanics sometimes feel deliberately designed to push you into spending more, as if the better players you need to succeed are always just out of reach, unless you're willing to pay. This cycle of frustration, combined with the temptation of opening ""just one more pack,"" turns what should be a fun experience into something more stressful and, at times, toxic. The game manages to tap into that part of your brain that makes you feel like you’re on the verge of a breakthrough, but in reality, it’s pulling you deeper into the grind, causing more frustration and emotional investment than it should.",False,english

Luckily I have friends who let me play on their consoles and experience the game.

The Story is not over bearing with characters speech that adds nothing to the game. A casual gamer looking for a couch co-op game can jump into the story and understand the general idea of what is happening and enjoy the story. Furthermore, someone who is decently well versed in the grim dark universe will appreciate characters building upon the setting and making the player feel as if they are apart of a multi planet defense against heretical xenos.

The game play is not exactly casual, offering a challenge to players that can be overcome with most any game play style chosen. The game brings back a hack and slash, co-op gamer missed by many of gamers. The combat is executed in a cinematic world built with care to detail, with brutal combat and satisfying finishers.

But it shows that Konami wants to get away from the recycle-old-game-and-stick-a-new-name-on scheme. Some ideas and approaches are very good (more movements without the ball, cross-play, transitionless corners and throw-ins, etc...), but the implementation is very miserable. To be honest, even old functions that have always worked flawlessly are miserable now. In the end, this just shows how hard it actually is to bring a completely new game to market instead of remarketing the same game for full price. I like the approach of putting more effort into the football games, bringing new features and taking risks. It's a shame that PES flopped this year, but since it's free, you shouldn't bitch so much. Kudos to Konami for daring to make this right step. I'll wait for EFootball until it's ready.

Edit.

The updated version of EFootball is not comparable to the beta version which was very criticized. The game runs very smoothly and I hardly had any bugs, the graphics and animations look very realistic especially on high graphics settings. The game dynamics are rarely disturbed by fading to freekicks or throw-ins, the game continues to run while the players are getting the ball ready, which is very good. When there are cut scenes they are well used and hardly interfere. It feels more like watching a game on TV.
The game dynamics have also improved a lot, offensive players move smartly and the defense also makes few mistakes. In order to get a goal situation you have to either trick the opponent to open up passing situations or outplay the opponent with well-directed passes. At the moment, besides the friendly matches and online games, there is only the Dream Team mode, where you create and manage a team online and play against the AI or online games. It is good that you can buy the standard players directly and do not have to pull from ""packs"". These then start at level 0 and you have to level them up to their normal value and then you can go a bit beyond that. Very good I found here the possibility that you can choose the value upgrades yourself and thus can form your perfect player. You can e.g. skill MBappe to be more focused on speed and dribbling to let him play more on the wing or increase the values for finishing and attacking to set him up as a center forward. The choice is up to you. Since Efootball is free, there is a fear that the game will become pay-to-win. So far, however, I have been able to do well with my non-pay-to-win team and have not had the feeling that I had a big disadvantage compared to the other players. The good thing is that Featured players and the ""normal form"" of the same players usually have the same values when they are at the highest level. Featured players just start at a higher value and don't need to level up as long. Also, Featured players often have an alternate focus on skills. Only some legend players that are hard to get are a lot better than the ""normal"" counterparts. I would have been happy if legendaries had been just as good and you only acquired them, for example, if you were a big fan, so as not to break the balance of the game. But so far opponents had only 2-3 legends in the team and the difference was not so big that you have no chance against them.

All in all, I think the game is good, it's fun and brings a lot of new features. But some corners must still be tweaked.",True,english

The game immerses you in a way that few can, combining its gripping story, breathtaking visuals, and impeccable soundtrack to pull you into the dystopian Night City. There were countless times where I would just stop to look around and take in the gorgeous views.

I found the blend of FPS and RPG elements to be very fun and engaging. Building up V's strength throughout the game was particularly satisfying for me, particularly in how it can interplay with the narrative, even if on the smaller side. Difficulty wise I thought it was pretty balanced overall. It does get on the easier side of things from mid to late game but I don't mind that at all. The game is limited to first person, which I didn't mind after awhile. It's an FPS after all. 
Overall, I loved the high octane, high stakes approach it takes to its combat.

I did not play this game when it first launched, so I have no idea what issues from release still remain. I can however report on the problems I did find regularly:
- Poor LOD Rendering
There were many times, particularly after installing the Phantom Liberty DLC, where the game's engine struggled a lot with loading LODs properly. I mainly noticed it with the NPCs and vehicles, especially when driving, where they would load at very low detail until you're like a few steps away. Rarely when driving, the road can just unload for some reason and become invisible for a couple seconds, which can really screw with you. This is pretty uncommon though.
- Low Traffic Density While Driving
When you're not driving around the city, the traffic is pretty normal. However, once you start going at high speeds on the road, traffic seems to diminish significantly. This does create an uncanny result considering its supposed to be a mega city. It seems the game does this to further save on resources, but it is still somewhat distracting how little traffic there can be.
- Vehicle Summoning
The game allows you to call your vehicle, and it will drive itself to you. Even to this day, the menu for this still says the feature is in beta. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any plans to properly finish it. Now, I bring this up because a lot of the time, the place that it chooses to spawn your car is..not great. Sometimes it will spawn on another road that's like a block away, and other times it spawns it in other vehicles. But on occasion, the car may straight up spawn in the air, where you can watch it gracefully tumble all the way to the ground. Other than traditional fast travel, cars and motorcycles are the de facto way to get around Night City, so a feature like this should probably have had more time in the oven.

Despite those recurring issues I had, they are nowhere near game breaking. They only hurt the already amazing immersion a bit. I did not really experience any crashes before installing mods, so those issues seem to be gone. In all, I definitely think the game is in a good place now. If you were thinking about getting Cyberpunk for yourself, I highly recommend it.",True,english

All the RPG elements you'd expect, fully voiced, great post-release maintenance/commitment and in a truly interesting non-fanstasy setting. The mechanics don't really mirror Cyberpunk 2020 or Cyberpunk: RED TTRPGs; while unfortunate, the mechanics in this game are solid.

And best of all, the game very moddable with a vibrant, engaged, and productive mod community.

Only disappointing aspect was that it has no 3rd person. You cannot see the character of the story, you cannot see their cool moves and action. Rather it's like you, the player at the computer, is there rather than the character of the story. And it wasn't immediately apparent how this weakens the whole experience.

But other than that there are only two minor points of weakness, both addressable in the mature product:
1. Boss fights assume certain style of play--the dev's preference. This is solvable by mods.
2. CDPR having their favorite story ending and putting weak effort into other endings because you should have thought like the devs and writers to get the best endgame experience [see Witcher 3]. This is solvable by research and then playing the fleshed out single ending CDPR envisioned.

Everything else is top notch, engaging, and fun. Has all the RPG elements you'd expect and good quests, decent story lines. DLC is lacking, but they did release one at least--it's also very decent; almost more interesting than the main storyline [again, see Witcher 3].

The World of Cyberpunk 2077 is a dark and gritty one. A dystopian but but also real future where you're either rich or barely surviving. but what makes this game beautiful is, despite it all, you keep fighting for a better life, never fully loosing hope even at your lowest of lows. the game shows this with not only your character but also the supporting cast. Characters who often seem hard and tuff like the city has forced them to be opening up to you and being vurnurable to you as you get to know them. Judy, Panam, heck even Johnny Silverhand. all characters who I will remember and cherish.

Now as to the gameplay when this game first came out it was, and I pardon my language, Dogshit... But ever since the 2.0 update they overhauled everything and somehow did a complete 180! With the gunplay going from feeling unimpactful and bland to OOMPHY in the best way possible and then the upgrade system acually feeling worth it with new abilities and customization to make truly unique and fun builds all of which are viable! I personaly love fully upgrading reflexes allowing me to dash and dodge around both on ground and mid-air for some really fun almost bullethell like movement or going for a more stealth build allowing you to quickly take out enemy bases and finish gigs with a quick swipe reall assassin style! just a few of the many ways to play the game and I can practically garantee that there is a playstyle for you! So much fun.

The music is also amazing and somethign I wanna highlight as a producer myself. It really perfected what Cyberpunk should sound like. It's drone like nature with these elements of punk music really fusing together in such a unique way! It just has this tensity to it that just feels suspenseful. Then there's the action music which I swear I would be so much stealthier if it didn't go as hard as it goes cuz DAMN it makes me pumped! It's so intense and adrenaline filled and fits so well to every senario! truly spectacular.
but the best tracks in the game for me are the more quiet ones. the ones that play in somber or joyful moments. the themes of the characters you meet. Johnnys theme using a cello/violin making it sound like a guitar somehow is just beautiful and really shows another side of johnny in a way. and leidmotives of ""never fade away"" (a song by Johnnys band) playing at just the right times making it almost a theme of sorts for the events that it plays in. I dunno It just adds so much to the imersion and I can't get enough of it.

And don't even get me started on the DLC. Phantom Liberty is one of the best expansions I have ever played. The district of Dogtown is dense and full of fun activities to do, but once again the highlights are the characters. Somehow they're even deeper than before, feeling like acual people who all have unique motives and personalities that when it came time to choose I couldn't decide cuz I cared so much for all of them. I wanted the best for all of them but due to the nature of the story (which i won't spoil) I could'nt and it was heartbreaking, but it also felt beautiful in a way. Just absolutly phenomenal story telling and a story I will never forget.

In the end I would personally highly recommend this game. It's a game I always come back to replay, a world that I can't get enough of and one of those games that gave me something I'll keep for the rest of my life. It might take some time to get into but trust me once ur in it will be an experience you will never forget. an experience that, despite it's dark nature, made me feel hope. A thing of beauty for sure.

and a thing of beauty will never fade away...
Keep fighting",True,english

The main story is staged in Night City, an open-world sandbox with a mix of neo-noir and ganster movie characters and narratives. While the DLC's is significantly smaller in scope, it's a tight, well written spy thriller that keeps some of the same beats (the heist elements) but remains fresh with new stakes and an interesting cast.
The RPG is well implemented: in addition to ""cyberware"" -interchangeable parts that influence your controls, movements patterns, weapon affinity and some gameplay interactions, you have 3 main variables that make for very deep character building: Attributes, Perks and Skills.
You have 5 main Attributes- each Attributes will have its own ""Perk"" tree. Raising an Attribute (up to a max of 20) will unlock more (and better) Perks. Attributes mostly have an influence on weapon proficiency and some interactions, but will also impact how you approach certain missions. Will you break the door? Can you hack the door? Can you stay hidden or will you ram through? The 3D environment of Night City helps you tackle situations with a wide variety of possible solutions.
While the ""Attributes"" can only be reset once per game, the Perks can be refunded and distributed again as many times as you wish outside combat, encouraging experimentation. You can see which weapons work best for you, how your perks interact with each other and your cybernetic implants.
The Skills progress naturally- anytime you perform an action, take down an enemy with a certain weapon, pass a dialogue or Attribute check- the related Skill will increase. Up to a max of 50, every 5 levels you will unlock a permanent boost.

I think the main downside to the game is how long it is- not all missions are created equal and sometimes it's a drag or a bit of a bore, but those moments are few and sandwiched between thrilling combat sequence. Didn't particularly care for the DB elements either.

Overall 9/10, the few narrative lapses or repetitive nature of some missions didn't spoil my fun enough to bring the score lower than that. I would just add that the soundtrack is a constant banger and is very serviceable to the story.",True,english

Takes everything from the first to a more grand scale. Abstracts away 'wood vs iron', for instance, in favor of factions and a council where laws are proposed and deals are made. Loving the gold accents in the menu and visuals. Soundtrack is gas. Yet these are only icing on the already delicious post-apocalyptic society-builder cake.

The game takes great strides to make things feel personal, as in how individuals in your society respond to events and feel.

I didn't play the first one, but heard much about it. So I'm not comparing it to anything, but to me this game is a masterclass in immersion and natural as well as guided storytelling. The mechanics are great and feel different from other games. It's original. The game doesn't hold your hand, the prologue serves as a tutorial, but doesn't feel like a tutorial: You're immediately fighting for survival, but the game never feels unfair. Here and there I wished the consequences of my actions were clearer, but you can always reload, and I suggest making multiple saves. I never got soft locked, but I'm sure you can.

You explore the world as you explore mechanics and the story unfolds. The story feels very authentically interlinked with what you do. When factions were mad at me, they had good reason to, and they all have reasonable stances, that just happen to conflict very often. Moral choices are nuanced.

You will be managing and balancing dozens of things at the same time, have to make sacrifices, sometimes heavy ones, but you always have clear and realistic short and long-term goals. Some self-imposed, some from the game's plot, and some just to keep your people alive and if possible, happy. For a city management game it's extremely exciting. Oftentimes I barely scraped by.

Other developers can learn from this. How to trust your audience: show them the basic with more show than tell, then throw them into the cold water and let them figure it out.

Special shout out to the the graphics and sound design. It's actually a very pretty game and I wish I could zoom in more (the zoom-in on generators doesn't do it for me).

Now that I finished the campaign I can't wait to play the sandbox mode, which seems pretty fleshed out with 7 starting locations and completely different factions from story mode.",True,english

They really improved it."" What the devs did with Frostpunk 2 is revamp the game to be almost a new game. 

You feel the constant pressure of your choices. Everything is on the brink of collapse as you try to balance the politics, failing machinery, and ever encroaching cold with resources that are few and far and between. This truly feels like a ""survival, post-apocalyptic setting"". You desperately need more food, you finally find some frozen food stores under the ice. So you go to build an extraction district to try and pull the resources out. Some of the workforce mining the coal out of the ice died from starvation or the frost. Now you do not have enough workers. So you pull from another area. Some of the children start to go feral as the city starts to descend into anarchy. The coal mine is not producing coal as it dries up, so your generator holding the cold barely at bay is running out of fuel now.  You make a deal with a colony for some of their oil to keep the heat on for a little longer. In doing so, one of the rising factions in the city begins to oppose you because they do not like the deal you made. 

Its a constant struggle of back and forth that makes you feel you are really on the precipice of extinction and about to go over. 
Game play is outstanding. Graphics and audio are great. Some audio sound bite loops (such as when you click on one of the factions) can get old fast. Minor nitpicking aside, this game is absolutely fantastic. No you do not need to buy the first game at all. This is well worth the 45 bucks to a somewhat small studio for game play that is infinitely better than any of the sludge the ""AAA"" studios will ever produce.",True,english

If there was a neutral rating I would give it. There is a good core of the game here, keeping much of the spirit of the first game.There is a good core of the game here, keeping much of the spirit of the first game.

Pros 
1 - Game looks great. Good atmosphere and art on the menus. Colors and well done to lean into the overall dystopia steam punk vibe. 

2 - More of a natural society progression. You don't just get to choose what society you'll be with a simple choice. Your laws, the factions you favor and your choices in events grow your society. This leads to tech and law unlocks. Makes for a fun RP experience and something refreshing to see in a city builder.

3 - Most of the core mechanics of the first game are intact, so resources and heat management especially are still very much the priority.  

4 - Game still has a great soundtrack and atmosphere all around.

Neutral 

1 -  It's on a larger scale than the first game so you don't build individual buildings, you just build districts. Your ascetic control of your colony is basically non-existent. For me this is irksome, but this really comes down to a personal preference. I miss being able to craft my colony to look a certain way. But this is purely an ascetic issue and I can't knock the game for it. 

Cons 

1 - This game should have an early access tag. It has several small bugs that can really just kill your run. You'll spend some amount of time online trying to figure out what happened until you realize it's a bug.
                - Example - First scenario in new london, you establish a colony for oil. My progress just stopped even with ample frost teams. I paused all other outpots to get more frost teams, that did not restart progress. When I sent people to establish the colony, it reduce the number of works in all my buildings in new london. This caused me to have less frost teams. Even after increasing worker count, my colony would not progress in building. Had to reload. Seems like a minor bug, but annoying because if you don't catch it right away it can kill your run.


2 - QoL is poor. Resource management is an integral part of this game. Everything is a slider when it comes to resources, being workers or raw materials. Some you can get precise numbers on because the slider also has small button allowing 1 quantity changes. Others do not have this option, because reasons. So you sometimes have exact control over how many workers are somewhere, or how many resources you send/receive. Other times you just get to throw a handful of workers at a new colony and hope it's close enough to the number you want. Also you can't scroll with arrow key, or middle mouse with the sliders either. Just click and hold. You also can't cancel buildings in progress, and if you lay a building down wrong have to just deal with it later. You also while planning to build, can only cancel in sequential order. Can't click on a tile to cancel just one and build somewhere else. Minor issue but again, just more lifting for the user for seemingly no reason. 

3 - UI is bad, like all form over function bad. You can hotkey to most important things, which is fine. You can also hover over your resources and most of the numbers up top to see a better breakdown. But the idea to have the 5 categories hang below your top UI not really be intractable at all is baffling to me. The worse they get, the longer the tail they get, which can end up cluttering the top of your screen. You also get zero information about them. Some are derived stats, some are all ready covered in your resource needs. They feel redundant and don't serve much purpose beyond the look. You also cannot short cut most actions in a district. It has an empty building slot? Well can't click on the building slot to do anything. Have to exit looking at the district, go to your buildings build menu which is different from your district build menu, find the right sub category for the building you want, then select it. Seems like a minor gripe but like...you can't build any of the buildings outside of their specific district type besides heat ones. Why do they need their own menu, why can they not be done from the district menu? They're upgrades, not independent items. Game becomes more dependent on pause with small things like this. 

4 - Game is gonna chug after you set up some colonies and managing more than one city. Needs some performance optimization.",False,english

It's very unpolished; they just tried to implement on top of the old version, but it feels and plays way worse. They tried to overcomplicate it with fancy menus and choices with 100 drop-down menus; it just feels like they put all these things in there just to have more options without thinking about the fun in the game, like the first one. It just feels like a mess; there is no clear way to describe it, but coming from over 142.8 hours in the first game, this feels like a different Frostpunk game...

The shift away from the neatness of the original makes it difficult to understand what’s happening at times, with too much filler content. Some research options appear across multiple tabs, causing confusion, and there’s a noticeable lack of quality-of-life features like the ability to cancel construction. Additionally, heat continues to be consumed even when a district is turned off, which feels counterintuitive.

Overall it emphasizes a macro approach, with the overall scale of ""The City"" and its inhabitants dialed all the way up. The population count is higher, there are more resource/types, you can create and maintain more than one city/settlement during a run, and the faction system is dynamic. I do miss the small scale of Frostpunk 1 at times. Starting off with a handful of settlers and watching them trudge throw snow and ice, some freezing to death, in a desperate effort to collect enough coal and other resources to survive.

The change in scale from the original, as others have pointed out, makes things a bit less impactful. I find myself going, ""well, that's the cost of doing business"" way too much.
However, my biggest issue is that, despite the delayed release, the game really could've benefited from another few months in the oven to polish off some of the more obvious bugs. For example, I've encountered a few weird UI glitches. That's to say nothing of the day-1 patch ""temporary fix"" for what is a pretty jarring audio crackling issue in big cities. It's not a good look to release it like this.

Please, developers, and I mean all game developers, not just 11-Bit Studios: Polish off your games. People will forgive less obvious bugs, but when you release a game with glaring issues that *had* to have been apparent prior to release, it's really bad form. Day-1 patches for these kinds of issues don't really mitigate the optics, in my book. Day-1 patches say to me, ""we know the game isn't finished, but we're releasing it anyway.""

In conclusion, this is a tentative ""not recommended"" from me, purely on the grounds of it being released without solving the aforementioned obvious bugs. I'm confident these issues will be fixed soon, but the game being released in this state leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",False,english

I've bought the deluxe edition of frostpunk 2 and i've got really disapointed spending 100.00$ for only a 6-8 hours campaign.

Yes there is the mode utopia, but this one feels like you doing the campaign all over again. There is no difference. The game feels boring after 29 hours of playtime. Once you get the captain role enforced. There is no more event.

It does feel like a natural progression from Frostpunk 1, in terms of scale. In both games, resource management is important and have far-reaching consequences if you do not manage it well. I do agree with some reviews that in Frostpunk 2, you don't feel as attached to the individuals when compared to Frostpunk 1. People, at least to a degree, are just numbers. But I did enjoy the statements from individual characters in the game in general. However, when I finished the main story, I wouldn't help but wonder if I did my best, or whether I did the right thing. All I could say was an attempt was made. I would argue there was an emotional attachment involved in Frostpunk 2, but not to the individual. Rather, I felt more attached to the city itself. Achieving that isn't easy and I do applaud 11-Bit Studios for taking a risk here. The game did do a good job at making things feel desperate near the end but I do admit, the music wasn't as noticeable for some reason.

amazing.
a few bad bosses, nothing a avg person cant manage.
needs to work on the progression of the game, I feel like I cant wear a armor set that's actually cool because you unlock a new craft every 1-2 hours and most of the time they are way better than what ever armor set you crafted before that. 
the combat is great and I feel like there is a lot of build variety especially when you get some of the mythical staffs. 
the game is long and great. ~50 hours for me to beat 6 chapters, and get the true ending so :)...

probably going to buy the dlc when ever it comes out, which is very soon actually because the base game was supposed to have like 11 chapters and most of the chapters had most of the design done",True,english

After finally folding and purchasing the base game at a discount, I quickly grew to love the combat system, methods of gaining power, and especially the story the game told. The most important part of any game to me is the story, followed by the combat mechanics, then the graphics. Cyberpunk smashed all my expectations so much so that I purchased Phantom Liberty at full price when I was halfway through the game, solely because I knew I wanted more content before the end of the game. I'm very glad I did. The DLC has been wonderful, and without spoiling it, I would rate it 2 tiers above the base game (7/10 - base, 9/10 DlC, for an average of 8/10). Note that 5/10 simply means ""average"" and reasonable for the experience/price. I fully recommend the DLC if you enjoyed the base game.",True,english

1. For some reason, when the chase starts and you get hit by a car and continue driving, we did not continue. Our car got pushed to the gate and didn't move. I had to restart.
2. Then when you start fighting scavs, it's needlessly hard. It's my 2nd playthrough, on hard difficulty. On hard, I killed Adam Smasher on 2nd try at just lvl 35 with sucky cyberware, and I'd say Adam Smasher is one of the hardest bosses in the game. This thing took me 5 tries. My advice -- when you get out of car, you get blades. Forget the blades, get back to pistol, find cover and be very careful as they'll shred you very quickly. Be careful with skulls and netrunners. First time I got killed by a runner.
3. After finally doing this, I go to the ""wounded scav"" and... nothing happens. It's bugged again. Trust me, I tried everything and I don't think I did anything unusual to cause it. 

At this point I just lost it. Come on, The DLC had been out for a year now, and the base game is 4 years old at this point. I understand that making games of this scale is hard.

The dlc is its own thing pretty much with an extra ending of its own, which has the added benefit of skipping the remainder of the core vidya.

Now, onto the good things: the script, the pacing, the dialogues, the execution of a properly polished thriller. The DLC adds some extra missions for old fixers. Fetch quests aside, the quest are good too, adding depth and nuance to the NPCs. Though the most important is the selection of end-game choices you're presented with. Between wetwork, dubious loyalties and complex motivations of dramatis personaes, someone did their homework on intelligence services so a lot of it offers a very authentic experience. A lot of times you leave feeling dirty - because that is the nature of the work. My only criticism is you couldn't off Meyers (it'd be tons of fun, I think), but otherwise it's next to excellent. Johnny's dialogue at the end of the lunar escape was a rare gem, diverging from his usual abrasive rants. Meeting Mr Hands in person was somewhat of a letdown, but more gigs from the sphinxian villain was welcome.

It's difficult to believe the DLC was produced by the same studio as the cliché and filth-filled dumpster fire that is the core game. The setting remains as disgusting as ever, with humanity locked in a dull and primitive state of neo-feudal corporate overlords or communes of plain-roaming barbarians, but Phantom Liberty redeems the price tag. If you find a way to skip to the DLC and just play the extra, do it: it is a real treat for any lovers of a spy drama - something Deux Ex tried and failed to do.

Imagine if James Bond, Keanu Reeves, and Idris Elba decided to throw a party in Night City, and you get to clean up the mess. That’s Phantom Liberty for you.

The expansion kicks off with the President of the New United States crash-landing in Dogtown. Yes, you read that right. Apparently, Air Force One now comes with a “crash here for plot development” button. You’re hired to rescue her, but not before you navigate through a maze of cybernetic baddies, morally ambiguous choices, and enough plot twists to make a pretzel jealous.

Idris Elba’s character, Solomon Reed, is the secret agent we all wish we could be. He’s suave, he’s mysterious, and he probably has a better skincare routine than you. Meanwhile, Keanu Reeves returns as Johnny Silverhand, still rocking that “I hate the system” vibe but with a touch more existential dread. It’s like watching your cool uncle go through a mid-life crisis, but with more explosions.

Dogtown itself is a marvel. It’s like someone took all the worst parts of a dystopian future and decided to make it a tourist attraction. The local wildlife includes cyber-enhanced gangsters and vending machines that might just try to sell you a grenade. But hey, at least the street food is to die for—literally.

The gameplay is a rollercoaster of emotions. One moment you’re making life-or-death decisions, the next you’re wondering why your character’s pants have suddenly disappeared. It’s all part of the Cyberpunk experience, folks. Embrace the chaos.

In conclusion, Phantom Liberty is the perfect blend of high-stakes drama, cybernetic mayhem, and unintentional comedy. It’s like a soap opera set in a dystopian future, and honestly, we wouldn’t have it any other way. So, grab your cyberdeck, put on your best trench coat, and dive into the madness. Just watch out for those vending machines.",True,english

Although unlike Dark Souls parrying is basically required just like Sekiro except the timing is a bit harder. Although I am a Souls veteran, I struggled immensely on the first somewhat challenging boss because it was pretty much a test of how well you could parry as simply whiff punishing between his attacks did very little damage. So parrying was the only way to get big damage by breaking his posture and riposting him. Once you master that, you've ""gotten good"" at LoP. There is also the rally system from Bloodborne, which just lets you regain most of the damage taken from blocking if you attack the opponent a few times after. The overall game has the same amount of polish as FromSoftware games, though it has a surprising amount of DNA from Code Vein in the sound and visual effects, and some mechanics like sliding down ladders and interacting with more things at your home base.

The first part of this review is for the general game, the second part is the threshold where I accepted it wasn't worth continuing.

Pros:
1.  The Legion arm mechanic is pretty cool.  Essentially preset secondary equipments that can be upgraded to add new passives to them.  Examples include a staggering grapple hook, a charge up electric blast, a landmine summoner, and a a retaliatory shield.  Legion arms allow you to get a boost against harder foes that your weapon proves insufficient for.
2.  Parry mechanics.  Depending on what kind of enemy your fighting, a perfect parry will either help stagger them for a combo hit or help shatter their weapon, reducing attack variety and damage.
3.  Specters act as boss assists if you're frustrated or unable to defeat a boss.  It's a pretty big help if your too frustrated.

Cons:
1.  Underwhelming soundtrack.  The only music in the game outside of the gramophone is against bosses, and they all sound pretty similar.
2.  Finite resources.  There's only one copy of each weapon, armor, and amulet, with no way to get more.  If you sold or missed an item, it's gone forever, the entire playthrough.  Quartz, the skilltree material, can't even cover half the skilltree without running out for the rest of the playthrough.  Cranks, allowing you to tinker with weapon scaling, are also finite, discouraging experimentation.  Consumables have to be slowly grinded for until chapter 5 when you can buy them.
3.  Rushed choices.  Any time the game has you make a narrative choice, it gives you about 6 seconds before automatically selecting whatever your cursor touched last, leaving no time to think anything through.  This leads to decisions feeling incoherent and shallow.
4.  Lack of information.  The game doesn't tell you what three of your six stats even do, making the early game confusing.  Status effects only tell you what they do once they've killed you.

Last part of my review is unfairness.  Up until Elysian Boulevard, the game does quite well with dying being your fault rather than cheap shots or instant death.  Once you reach the boss there, you have your first instance of simply full on stun locking you with no escape method.  Once you trudge your way through that, you soon hit the swamp monster, with the ability to also kill you in one inescapable combo, but with the addition of being far too durable to kill with consumables and shredding your specter.  Outside of bosses, several things lead to being unfair.  Several points have enemy locations that you can't reasonably deal with, leading to barely avoidable damage.

Keep in mind that this is my first souls like, so I can't compare it well to others.  I do enjoy difficult games such as Dead Cells and Celeste, but difficult and unfair are rather different things.",False,english

This game compared to most Souls-like games has given the most care out of any games I have seen. Not many games give an equal fairness into their mechanics besides this one. Every other souls-like game I have played has never given me much satisfaction compared to this one either. The story, the combat, the variety of combat weapons, and the goddamn level design and setting of the game just comes out as one of my Top 10 games of all time.

I own Elden Ring, but I never completed it because I got too lost in its open-world concept. However, this game was an amazing introduction to the genre, especially considering it comes from a smaller studio, not a massive corporation.

The story is captivating, and the game does a great job guiding you through it. The voice acting is absolutely incredible—most games have at least a bit of cringe in their dialogue, but not this one. The performances are top-notch.

Combat is really fun and rewarding. Parrying can break enemies' weapons, and you can combine different weapons and handles (I mostly used boss weapons throughout the game). I didn’t find the game overly difficult either—you can even beat some bosses with throwable items, and certain bosses allow you to summon an aid, which is super helpful.

The music is also insane. It’s one of the highlights of the game for sure. After beating it, I immediately wanted to start another playthrough, but I’ve heard that DLC and a sequel have been announced, so I’m waiting for that. When the DLC drops, I’m definitely doing another run with a new weapon setup.

If you’ve never played a Souls game, I really believe this is a great entry point into the genre. I highly recommend it!",True,english

Great story. Mostly great game. 3 of the bosses try hard to ruin it.

Given the fact that this is a game built almost entirely on parrying, it's frustrating when you can't stop a chain of actions to parry or dodge. Also any hit seems to slightly stagger P. For a split second you can't move and for just slightly longer you can't parry or dodge. Not a problem for most of the game, but for the very fast bosses chaining attacks, it's annoying you can see P not reacting to your input as another attack comes in. Yet for the most part, your attacks don't have the same effect.

There are minor issues with it such as bosses that jump very high in the air, yet the camera angle cannot look straight up. In some places it's like ledges are covered in grease. It's possible to be pinned against a wall or object by an enemy and have no way out, it's effectively a death sentence with certain enemies.

*Minor spoilers*
Most of the bosses are fun with good cut scenes.
3 of them are not fun. The King of Puppets, Laxasia and the Nameless puppet.
There is clearly a reason the achievement % drops off at each of these.
The times I beat them, it was luck of the draw of how aggressive the boss was feeling that round.

Sometimes it feels like that game goes out of it's way to kill you if you do ""too well"" and get close to killing the boss quickly in the first few rounds. You'll soon be punished with an onslaught. Yet if you just stand there and practice parrying, you don't get the same intense beating.

For the fights with the spectre, for me just using a single HP re-gen wish on it worked well to keep the boss distracted for longer. Other wishes are okay, but nowhere near as impactful as simply having two of you in the battle for longer.

Save throwing items until you have the boss down to <10% health, then use them to help finish it quick. Otherwise don't bother using them, they're effectively a limited resource before you'll have to go out farming for them. 

I beat each of the above 3 by using fable arts and throwables in those last few moments.",True,english

Lies of P sees you lead as Gepetto's puppet in a twisted, gloomy take on the folktale of Pinocchio. Waking up in an eerie train station, you soon make your way outside to the city of Krat, where a sudden trigger in the puppets causes a haunting massacre that sets the tone for the rest of the game.

     On that note, atmosphere is the name. Hotel Krat is your central hub, and it quickly evolved from being a brief trip to level up my weapons into a safe retreat where I could listen to a vibrant soundtrack in the background as I spoke with the many charismatic faces that made up this iconic location. It's not just the hub area - everything from oil-lined streets to infested cathedrals, the immense amount of detail present within the level design itself across most of the chapters is incredibly impressive. Whether it was my first playthrough or my sixth, I could not help but immerse myself in all of the intricately placed bodies & texts around the city that truly cements this game as an all-time example of how to do proper environmental storytelling within linear experiences. Neowiz and Round8 really wear the inspiration on their sleeves with the worldbuilding here and it's very well executed. (Note: it runs flawlessly for me on an upper-end rig, but even on my steam deck it is the best performing game I own. It's also very nicely balanced and well-paced. I would say I preferred the difficulty around launch, as it really heightened my enjoyment of this game in a unique way because of how challenging it was. But it's still a decent challenge and NG+ definitely brought that difficulty back.) 

     Combat is really where Lies of P hits all of its strides for me. As a fan of FromSoftware's 'soulsborne' entries for the better part of a decade, I believe Lies of P implements so many positive spins on their formula that I would recommend this over the traditional souls games to any player, regardless of experience (well... maybe play Sekiro.) For example, one of my favorite mechanics is pulse recharge, which allows you to gain one more charge to your healing consumable if you are at zero. This feature would change the entire dynamic of so many of my fights in an instant. Maybe I'm playing defensively, I've got two more heals and 60% of the boss's health left; in scenarios like this, every single time I reached zero heals, my brain would switch to aggression immediately in the hopes of regaining a charge and feel more 'comfortable.' I cannot speak to everyone's experience, but this mechanic made me a better player over time as I was PUSHED into being more active in my gameplay and subsequently rewarded with the most satisfying sound effect I've heard since the Halo CE shield recharge as a single pulse cell materializes right back into your upper belt. 

     Another great feature to the combat sandbox is the ability to assemble weapons. This is the single-most innovative design choice that Lies of P offers. Every weapon comes in two distinct parts, the blade tip and the handle. Each part has their respective stats; however, you can alter the handle to scale off of different stats than the ones it drops with. This opens up a lot of customization and encourages player experimentation, because at no extra-cost, your entire moveset and ability options can change in a matter of seconds. I myself am a Guts sword girl through and through, but even I felt compelled to experiment and eventually beat the game with my own ridiculous combinations. (Note: For me, this self-expression was VERY important in my enjoyment of the game, and I think it's a great innovation to the souls combat formula to allow your players to test out ANY weapon handle's moveset with... every other weapon's blade. Admittedly boss weapons are restricted from being customized and the scaling of both parts' stab/slash stat means that your options for good damage are inherently limited, but it offers so much freedom regardless that I would not mind seeing it return in the sequel.) 

     Story is the point I want to end this off on. For as long as I have cherished Bloodborne's lore, the original trilogy's lore, etc. I have never actually felt connected to the events of the stories presented in souls-like games. There's always been a strange disconnect for me being able to enjoy the challenge of the gameplay rather than caring about the story. I can say Lies of P genuinely moved me in a way no other games in this subgenre have. I believe the most obvious explanation for this is the greater emphasis on dialogue and player onboarding that Lies of P engages in. There is a real sense here with the amount of dialogue you'll receive from a character off-screen during gameplay or in the middle of a boss fight that Neowiz really wanted to make players feel INVOLVED in the big character moments as they are happening, rather than reading about them from a lore description (which is also a method of storytelling present with a lot to read up on that is engaging.) To be clear, I have no issue with this, but I really prefer the focus on character engaging with me, the truths/lies you decide to tell them, and the almost-immediate consequences those decisions can have as they relay their reactions back to you. You can ignore or fight multiple bosses by making a simple decision. I like that. The narrative throughline that is happening above all of the character stories is decently executed, but the character quests is really where Lies of P shines (shoutout to Arlecchino.) Everyone is voice acted phenomenally, and this could not be a Lies of P review without making mention of how pivotal this game's original soundtrack is to the overall experience. The music feels tied to the characters' stories, as many records you can play back at Hotel Krat are received from quest completions. This makes even something as seemingly trivial as playing a record on a record player feel rewarding in itself, as you learn more about an NPC's journey through this world or simply enjoy a great tune in the background. 

     This has become my comfort game, and affectionately so. That doesn't mean it is devoid of things I disliked, as the final area of the game, Arche Abbey, has got to be the single-most tedious level I have played in recent memory. Running through this moody grey wasteland to a grey tower with grey floors and repeated enemies from throughout the entire game got tiring incredibly fast, and it's a shame that the area with this game's pinnacle challenges is also so uninspired in its design. Additionally, I do not think the armor system, dubbed ""Defense parts,"" is particularly exciting. I think this could be fleshed out a little more, but finding more parts throughout the game is almost never exciting because they are always going to be better than your previous find, and they do not change any part of your puppet's appearance. I do like the cosmetics available here, but I definitely prefer the more free-form style of armor expression in other souls-likes. The legion arm system is probably the most disappointing aspect for me, delivering options to customize your limb similar to the prosthetic tools in Sekiro. I do not like the implementation in this game because it feels stiff to me. This is not something I have the knowledge to explain away, but it feels very restricted and with the low amount of legion I always have, it just left a lot to be desired for me because I mainly relied on parrying and counterattacking. 

     Despite my negatives, I adore this game. At the time of writing I have unlocked everything pre-DLC and waiting in anticipation for it as well as the recently announced sequel. If you've ever got a weekend to knockout a surprisingly compelling souls-like, this is absolutely the one for you.",True,english

Combat is fast-paced and has a bit of a learning curve, but is extremely satisfying once it clicks. Learning when to parry vs block, attack with a weapon vs throwbacks vs weapon art was fun and engaging. 

It also looks great and runs smoothly. Even on the Steam Deck with decent graphic settings, I was easily keeping 60 FPS.

Some people have criticized it for not being as open world as a game like Elden Ring, but I see that as a positive aspect of Lies of P. Being able to have a more linear path made the gameplay tight and paced well. It also never felt like it overstayed it's welcome, like I wind up feeling about many open world games.

This is the only game I've ever been motivated to 100% and can't wait for the DLC and sequel.

I'm recommending and warning you against buying this game at the same time.

You have the problems - the game's approach to puzzles is literally insulting to your intelligence. Every time you encounter a puzzle, the companion you're with tells you how to solve it before you even have a chance to take a look around. ""Hey, maybe that thing above you is gonna open a pathway"" and that's literally every puzzle in the game. This should be an accessibility option, you should be able to shut your companions up when you're trying to solve the already trivial puzzles. Sure the combat is still nice, story is nice, but this? Its insulting. Not a single puzzle goes without your companion telling you exactly how to solve it. ""Woow, what if we freeze this?"" and the moment you try anything, they will say something like ""oh no maybe lets try something else"" or ""oh yes we did it"" to indicate the correct solution which they already gave to you to begin with.

LOOK HERE    ---->    The PSN drama isn't as bad here as it was with helldivers, since in helldivers you could buy and play the game for like 3 months before they made it impossible to play for some regions. Here on the other hand you had warnings of the PSN requirement from the very start. Is it okay to have mandatory PSN requirements for a PC version of a single player game? 
Definitely a garbage decision which is clearly one of the biggest flaws of the newer games to come out. Some regions will require you to link a phone number to check your age, I think it is the case for the UK. The other ones will ask for your postal code and real name - it's all going to a third party website which is KNOWN for losing your data to frequent data leaks and hacks. Obviously PSN doesn't care whether you own or even intend to own a PS5 for this, you still need the account because they want to collect more data, it's as simple as this.

Having said that, I think the game itself is great, the unlocked framerate makes it even smoother to play to be honest. Then on the other hand, if you're not okay with this invasion on your personal data security, maybe rethink purchasing it. Same applies to some specific regions of the world which require even more data than other regions. I really suggest you look it up before you buy the game.

TLDR: PSN bad, game doesn't respect your intelligence with insane amounts of handholding but good story and good gameplay overall. Not goty but buy this if you can overlook the PSN drama.",True,english

The game definitely feels like it doesn't respect your time with a fairly large map that takes awhile to move around in. Making things such as a minecart network feels like a hassle, since mine carts  / boats aren't equipped to your character, but placed on the rail network, so if you die, you'll have to walk all the way back to get your vehicle.  Fast travel points are few and far between, and the only way (As far as I know) to create an additional fast travel point is extremely resource intensive and has a TEN minute cooldown.

You'll also need a large amount of materials for a lot of stuff in the game, which the game seems to flirt with automating the process a bit by having automated drills to get these resources for you.  The way you can automate things is extremely basic however, and will require you to just randomly explore until you find an appropriate node you can place your drills at. 

The gearing for combat in this game also feels pretty basic, and doesn't have as much synergies as I'd like. For example, I equipped an armour set that increases crit chance upon poisoning an enemy. However I found that this trait doesn't proc when using a range weapon that poisons enemies, when using a character skill that inflicts poison whenever you deal damage, or when using a pet that poisons enemies. It seems to only proc when using a poison melee weapon - which wasn't mentioned in the description of the armour set. 

The breaking point for me in this game was [spoiler] A large underwater sea section, which you basically need a boat for traveling around at. There's a water boss in this section without a fast travel point near it. Dying to it not only means having to make the long trek back, but you'll either need to remake your really expensive boat or make a long land bridge back to your stuff[/spoiler]

Ultimately, I was looking for something to scratch my survival crafting itch, but there's not enough here to justify the massive grind.",False,english

The progression of this game is fantastic and the crafting system is easy to use/follow.  Go-karts, Boating, PvE, PVP, boss battles... I was never bored playing this game as there is always something to do.  The customization you are allowed to make in game is endless (painting, flooring, walls, farming, automation, mob spawning, etc.).  Essentially you need to defeat certain bosses to gather parts to power the core, which will unlock more of the available map.  There are also optional bosses, ALL of which have fun mechanics and I recommend trying all boss fights.  The appearance of the game to me was appealing, giving almost a retro feel to the game.  This game felt like it took great aspects from other games I've played and put it into one. 
 Very fun game, definitely recommend it.  

Things I've learned/tips:
1.)  Using the Map - to place the Icons, select the desired icon and click the middle mouse button on the map to add; click on same spot to remove.  Mark boss fighting/summoning locations to find easier later on.
2.)  If you want to customize flooring that doesn't allow it to be painted; put a ""glass floor"" on top of it, then paint it.  May find a color you like w/ that pattern.
3.)  Create Scanners to find bosses, sooo much more convenient than blindly running around the map.
4.)  Save the figurines you collect.  There's a way to ""power"" them to have them spawn that type of mob; they do not drop loot, though still grant exp for your skill ups.
5.)  You have 3 different gear sets, recommend binding those sets to hotkeys.  Some fights may be much easier if/when you switch armor sets/tactics during the fight.

Started with hard mode and it provided enough of a challenge to keep the game interesting. The game provides enough variety of activities to keep you exploring without tiring out from any one activity. When you get tired of fishing, for example, you move on to something else for a while. 

I'm not a min/max kind of player, so I do my own builds with whatever I find via natural play through and was able to find some of the legendary weapons in good time. Ranged weapons are very good in this game, especially physical ranged like the daggers. Overall, Armor sets favor physical melee and ranged builds. There are some for casters or summoners as well, but they aren't very strong end game and fall off fast. Mainly because there are only two books to summon creatures. At some point  the mana cost gets to be too high and the bats are too dumb for combat situations to really focus on summons and I found myself using daggers or other weapons like the fireball staff to compensate. I really really tried making a summoner build work on its own, but I couldn't get through some of the content even though I was geared fairly well. Switched to physical range and beat everything no problem. At the time of me writing this, I have only the remaining two titans left, which I'm about to tackle next.

I do feel like the game suffers from an identity crisis. Does it want to be an open world survival like Minecraft, something casual like Stardew Valley, or more of a Boss a Rush type of game?

The postive thing ia that you get a little bit of all 3, but the negative is that you have to deal with game mechanics that intentionally slow you down.

Example, Trying to farm Wool, but you can only do it every 10 real time minutes. Bosses that have a cooldown before they respawn. Or farming for the 3 upgrade materials, Emearld,Ruby, and Sapphire which take forever without a Mob spawner. 

If you can look past the obnoxious grind for materials, I think youll enjoy your stay here. Alot of these materials arent necessary until later in the game depending on how fast you push into the next zone.


Boss are cool. Lots of sets and diversities. The upgrade station allows all early gear to stay relevant if one choose to upgrade them. 

Looking forward to future updates. Hoping they remove uncessary bottlenecking or change them in a way that is less annoying. 

Example, Cattle should give the materials right away, Then go on a cooldown. Instead of feeding them, waiting 10 mintues then getting the item.",True,english

A Personal Journey into Peaceful Creativity:

From the moment I launched Tiny Glade, I felt as though I'd stepped into a serene oasis far removed from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Developed by the indie studio Pounce Light, this game isn't just about building structures—it's about building moments of peace and allowing your imagination to wander freely.


Visual Poetry in Motion:

The game's visuals are nothing short of enchanting. The hand-crafted art style feels warm and inviting, like flipping through the pages of a beautifully illustrated storybook. Each element, from the gently swaying trees to the softly glowing windows of a cottage, is rendered with such care that it’s impossible not to feel a sense of wonder. I often found myself pausing just to watch the way the sunlight filtered through the leaves or how the shadows danced across the rolling hills.


Embracing the Freedom to Create:

What sets Tiny Glade apart is its emphasis on unstructured creativity. There are no timers ticking down or resources to hoard—just an open canvas waiting for your touch. The grid-free building system felt incredibly liberating. I could effortlessly draw a winding stone wall that morphed seamlessly into a quaint archway or let a cobblestone path meander through a meadow without constraints.

At one point, I started constructing a small village nestled at the edge of a forest. As I added little details—a lantern here, a flowerbed there—the place began to feel alive. It was as if the game was encouraging me to tell my own story without uttering a single word.


An Auditory Hug:

The sound design is like a gentle hug for your ears. The soft rustle of leaves, distant bird songs, and the occasional whisper of the wind combined to create a soundscape that was both relaxing and rejuvenating. The music is subtle, never overpowering the experience, but always enhancing the mood.

Reflections on User Experience:

Navigating through Tiny Glade is a breeze. The intuitive controls allowed me to focus on creating rather than fumbling with mechanics. There was a moment when I accidentally erased a section of my build, and instead of feeling frustrated, I found that the game's forgiving nature turned it into an opportunity to try something new. It's rare to find a game that so seamlessly blends user-friendliness with depth.


The Joy of Unwinding:

In a world where games often demand so much from us—be it quick reflexes, strategic thinking, or constant vigilance—Tiny Glade is a welcome reprieve. It's a space where you can slow down, take a deep breath, and let your mind wander.


Final Thoughts:

Tiny Glade isn't just a game; it's an experience—a gentle reminder of the joy found in simplicity and creativity. It rekindles that childlike wonder we often lose along the way. Whether you're an avid gamer looking for something different or someone who simply wants a peaceful escape, Tiny Glade offers a sanctuary worth visiting.",True,english

The game is beautiful but not as innocent as it looks. The real fun is in giving yourself a task and then solving it. Sometimes it takes less than a minute and sometimes quite a few minutes. Tools seem rudimentary but you can do a lot with them if you know what you are doing. At the beginning you don't.

Some remarks:
- edge scrolling needed ASAP. All the city builders have it and I am trying to use it all the time. WASD is clumsy.
- save system is not intuitive at all. 
- smoke looks like a paper towel floating above the chimney. If you have several houses with chimneys it seems that they are having a toilet paper feast. 

For the future:
- bigger terrain
- sheep and ducks are nice but I do miss people; they would not have to do anything, just move around.

There's no tutorial but I didn't need one, the controls are so simple and easy to understand. I love how everything falls so perfectly into place. Amazing lighting and ambiance, this game really is a vibe. My only complaint is that I wish we had some way to customize the inside of buildings a little bit, at least buildings that have one side open like a stable for the sheepies. I wish we could place benches and hay bales and flower pots on our own instead of them only spawning randomly with windows.

[i]I am a seasoned gamer, I played from A to Z, hundreds and even more hundreds of games since the '90, I know my games and am proud of it. I saw this game, a few days ago, thought it looked nice, relaxing; I saw it had a demo and that its full release wasn't far away. I got immediately hooked, Elden Ring style, but without the frustration and concentration factor, replaced with utter calmness, peace of mind.[/i]

[b]Review(?):[/b]
The game itself is as easy as formidable, it delivers in what it wants you to do and what you actually want to do.
I'm no architect, but I managed to create little scenarios that made me chuckle as I was astonished by how beautiful and cute everything looked; every time I am done and happy with the results of that session, I take screenshots.
You could include ""Background Creator"" in the game's tags, because they are so gorgeous and ""soft"" that it calms you just by looking at a picture of something you created, out of literally nothing.

-Having the possibility to play a demo is a major up: every game should give you this opportunity before buying.

-The price is.. great, I was afraid to find 30-40-50 euros at its release, but they stayed true to what the game is; it's easy to find games that cost double and triple of this one and aren't this memorable nowadays, so thank you for that.

-No crash has ever happened, not in the full release nor the demo. I locked it at 60fps, render scale at 1.1 having my pc's performance set quite low so to not make it work, practically at all. Increasing the render scale increases the impact on your pc by a lot, can't say why as I have quite good specs. Upping the render scale to ""just"" 2.0 squashes my fps to around 20, but I'm using my pc in, almost, sleep mode. If you have problems with performance, lower the render scale by 0.1 until you're happy, it will still look good.

-I've read some reviews that say how this game is lacking in content, that they played a couple dozen minutes and ""finished it"", to that I can just say that they aren't made for this kind of games and that would be ok if they would say so. Not recommending a game that isn't in your alley, and not specifying it, is in my opinion, wrong. You could play hundreds of hours and not get tired (please not consecutively); the content is in your head. I just put a window on corner of a tower-like square building, then I put a second, and a third, at the end I had a section of the tower converted into a 360° window, it all worked so good and naturally that I stopped and thought what a great job the devs made, because they did.

-Sometimes it's ""hard"" to start without nothing, but if you continue you'll be amazed by the results; the glades start with something already pre-built, to give you an idea and the daily ""challenge"" is great for a quick session where you continue something, I presume, they created for the occasion.

[b]Verdict:[/b]
A cute and relaxing building/city builder that gives you the reins to your imagination (in this context of course).
Enough content for as long as your imagination is fresh and trained, or you're willing to let go for a while and just click away; there's a start, but no end.
I am sure they'll add even more nice content, decorations, not for us to place individually, but seamlessly attack to what is around it (tables and chair on a flat roof for example), maybe more wall designs; I'm very confident they'll continue to work on it, and deliver.

It's a [b]9/10[/b] for me, it is just that beautiful and meets its promises like no other game lately.

With a heavy focus on realism and player choice, this survival sandbox offers a deeply immersive experience that few other games can match. Whether you’re managing your character’s health, building your dream base, or evading hordes of undead, Project Zomboid keeps you on your toes at every moment. Having spent over 730 hours in the game, I can confidently say that it delivers one of the best survival experiences available today.

1. Realism Done Right
Despite the fictional backdrop of a zombie apocalypse, Project Zomboid nails realism in almost every aspect of gameplay. The most valuable tip for any new player is simply: ""What would you do in this situation?"" The game's health system is intricate, with injuries, illnesses, and mental states all playing a role. Clothes protect you from zombie bites, degrade over time, and help regulate body temperature, which is vital. Mechanics like repairing vehicles, dealing with character traits and professions, and managing inventory weight make everything feel real. I especially love how character emotions and moods affect gameplay – it’s small touches like these that elevate Project Zomboid to another level of immersion.

2. An Open World That Never Ends
The current game world is massive, and despite having played over 730 hours, I still didn't explore all the areas. I admire the sheer size of the map, and with upcoming updates promising to expand it further and even include randomly generated maps in the distant future. Project Zomboid also offers infinite gameplay and replayability. It’s one of those survival games you can play over and over without ever getting tired.

3. Sandbox Customization Options
One of my favorite aspects is the ability to tailor the world to your liking. From the number and behavior of zombies to loot distribution, characters (players), and more, Project Zomboid lets you tweak almost anything. It gives you the power to create a world that fits your personal playstyle or challenge yourself with tougher scenarios.

4. Character Creation and Professions
This is hands-down one of my favorite features in the game. Choosing different professions and character traits, both positive and negative, significantly changes how the game plays. I also appreciate the subtle bonuses and drawbacks that aren’t immediately obvious – it adds an extra layer of depth. The balance in this system is present, too, so don’t expect to create an overpowered character unless you tweak the sandbox settings to do so!

5. Community Mods
While Project Zomboid doesn’t need mods to be great, the fact that they’re available is a huge bonus. The modding community has added incredible content, from enhanced realism to new vehicles, traits, weapons, and crafting options. There’s too much to describe in one review! That said, I recommend playing without mods at first to truly grasp the game’s mechanics, but later on, mods can make the experience even better.

6. Skill Levels and Physical Attributes
Project Zomboid features an extensive skill system that allows players to improve their characters through practice and experience. Skills are divided into categories like combat, crafting, survival, and agility, each having a noticeable impact on gameplay. Combat skills such as aiming and reloading become crucial for firearm users, while melee skills like blunt and blade proficiency determine how effective you are with weapons like baseball bats or axes. Crafting skills, including carpentry, metalworking, and tailoring, let you fortify your base, repair clothes, or even create tools from scratch.
Survival skills like foraging and fishing allow you to live off the land when resources run dry, and farming lets you grow your own food, providing a sustainable source of nutrition. Agility skills, such as sneaking and lightfooted, are essential for staying hidden from zombies, while sprinting helps you escape when the situation gets dire.
Physical attributes like strength and fitness are equally important, as they directly affect how much weight you can carry, how fast you tire, and how effective you are in combat. Improving your strength means you can carry heavier loads and hit harder with melee attacks, while better fitness ensures you can run longer distances and recover faster from exhaustion. Each skill progresses the more you use it, making every action in the game feel meaningful and rewarding.

7. Intriguing (But Optional) Lore
While the storyline isn’t central to the player’s experience yet, it does exist, and it’s fascinating. I only started diving into the game’s lore after playing for about 500 hours, and once I did, I was hooked. I went so far as to read up on the game’s backstory online (beware of spoilers!) Exploring the lore adds a new dimension to the game. I highly recommend getting to know the lore yourself!

8. A Sandbox Experience
Want to build? Build. Want to destroy? Go ahead. In Project Zomboid, your creativity (and characters human possibilities) are your only limits. The only challenge is gathering materials, which makes sense given the post-apocalyptic setting. But with enough time and motivation, you can accomplish incredible things. This open-ended approach is perfect for players who enjoy creating and building their own worlds.

9. Active Developer Support
The game is still in early access, and while it may not be updated on a daily basis, the developers deliver large, meaningful updates. They listen to player feedback, fix bugs, and continue to improve the game without ignoring the community, which is something I greatly respect.

10. Hidden Depths
Just when you think you’ve learned everything there is to know about Project Zomboid, it surprises you. The game is full of hidden mechanics and features that add to the depth of the experience. I’ve had several moments where I thought I had mastered the game, only to discover a new layer of complexity. It’s a game that keeps on giving.

11. Fair Price
Finally, let’s talk about the price. For what Project Zomboid offers, the price is perfect. But if you’re looking to save a bit of money, it’s always worth waiting for a sale. Either way, you’re getting your money’s worth for this gem of a game.

Project Zomboid is a truly exceptional survival game that combines deep realism with sandbox freedom. Whether you're fighting off zombies, building your own fortress, or scavenging for supplies, every moment feels impactful. With continuous updates, an active modding community, and endless replayability, it’s a game that will keep you coming back for more. I can’t recommend it highly enough to fans of survival games or anyone looking for a challenging, immersive experience.",True,english

The game definitely feels like it doesn't respect your time with a fairly large map that takes awhile to move around in. Making things such as a minecart network feels like a hassle, since mine carts  / boats aren't equipped to your character, but placed on the rail network, so if you die, you'll have to walk all the way back to get your vehicle.  Fast travel points are few and far between, and the only way (As far as I know) to create an additional fast travel point is extremely resource intensive and has a TEN minute cooldown.

You'll also need a large amount of materials for a lot of stuff in the game, which the game seems to flirt with automating the process a bit by having automated drills to get these resources for you.  The way you can automate things is extremely basic however, and will require you to just randomly explore until you find an appropriate node you can place your drills at. 

The gearing for combat in this game also feels pretty basic, and doesn't have as much synergies as I'd like. For example, I equipped an armour set that increases crit chance upon poisoning an enemy. However I found that this trait doesn't proc when using a range weapon that poisons enemies, when using a character skill that inflicts poison whenever you deal damage, or when using a pet that poisons enemies. It seems to only proc when using a poison melee weapon - which wasn't mentioned in the description of the armour set. 

The breaking point for me in this game was [spoiler] A large underwater sea section, which you basically need a boat for traveling around at. There's a water boss in this section without a fast travel point near it. Dying to it not only means having to make the long trek back, but you'll either need to remake your really expensive boat or make a long land bridge back to your stuff[/spoiler]

Ultimately, I was looking for something to scratch my survival crafting itch, but there's not enough here to justify the massive grind.",False,english

The progression of this game is fantastic and the crafting system is easy to use/follow.  Go-karts, Boating, PvE, PVP, boss battles... I was never bored playing this game as there is always something to do.  The customization you are allowed to make in game is endless (painting, flooring, walls, farming, automation, mob spawning, etc.).  Essentially you need to defeat certain bosses to gather parts to power the core, which will unlock more of the available map.  There are also optional bosses, ALL of which have fun mechanics and I recommend trying all boss fights.  The appearance of the game to me was appealing, giving almost a retro feel to the game.  This game felt like it took great aspects from other games I've played and put it into one. 
 Very fun game, definitely recommend it.  

Things I've learned/tips:
1.)  Using the Map - to place the Icons, select the desired icon and click the middle mouse button on the map to add; click on same spot to remove.  Mark boss fighting/summoning locations to find easier later on.
2.)  If you want to customize flooring that doesn't allow it to be painted; put a ""glass floor"" on top of it, then paint it.  May find a color you like w/ that pattern.
3.)  Create Scanners to find bosses, sooo much more convenient than blindly running around the map.
4.)  Save the figurines you collect.  There's a way to ""power"" them to have them spawn that type of mob; they do not drop loot, though still grant exp for your skill ups.
5.)  You have 3 different gear sets, recommend binding those sets to hotkeys.  Some fights may be much easier if/when you switch armor sets/tactics during the fight.

Hope the above helps, enjoy!",True,english

Started with hard mode and it provided enough of a challenge to keep the game interesting. The game provides enough variety of activities to keep you exploring without tiring out from any one activity. When you get tired of fishing, for example, you move on to something else for a while. 

I'm not a min/max kind of player, so I do my own builds with whatever I find via natural play through and was able to find some of the legendary weapons in good time. Ranged weapons are very good in this game, especially physical ranged like the daggers. Overall, Armor sets favor physical melee and ranged builds. There are some for casters or summoners as well, but they aren't very strong end game and fall off fast. Mainly because there are only two books to summon creatures. At some point  the mana cost gets to be too high and the bats are too dumb for combat situations to really focus on summons and I found myself using daggers or other weapons like the fireball staff to compensate. I really really tried making a summoner build work on its own, but I couldn't get through some of the content even though I was geared fairly well. Switched to physical range and beat everything no problem. At the time of me writing this, I have only the remaining two titans left, which I'm about to tackle next.

I do feel like the game suffers from an identity crisis. Does it want to be an open world survival like Minecraft, something casual like Stardew Valley, or more of a Boss a Rush type of game?

The postive thing ia that you get a little bit of all 3, but the negative is that you have to deal with game mechanics that intentionally slow you down.

Example, Trying to farm Wool, but you can only do it every 10 real time minutes. Bosses that have a cooldown before they respawn. Or farming for the 3 upgrade materials, Emearld,Ruby, and Sapphire which take forever without a Mob spawner. 

If you can look past the obnoxious grind for materials, I think youll enjoy your stay here. Alot of these materials arent necessary until later in the game depending on how fast you push into the next zone.


Boss are cool. Lots of sets and diversities. The upgrade station allows all early gear to stay relevant if one choose to upgrade them. 

Looking forward to future updates. Hoping they remove uncessary bottlenecking or change them in a way that is less annoying. 

Example, Cattle should give the materials right away, Then go on a cooldown. Instead of feeding them, waiting 10 mintues then getting the item.",True,english

Patience. This game requires you to be patient with its storytelling. The above quote perfectly describes the game with its phenomenal storytelling and visuals. The game devs have carefully crafted the way the story is being presented. The cutscenes might make some players hesitant to continue, but just be patient and keep progressing, the end is worth it.

I myself have no problem sitting back and absorbing the story through cutscenes. The grappling chain arm and game mechanics have good momentum to enjoy the gameplay. I wish that there were some more upgrades or weapons customization but it's still fun and exciting trying to clear the levels.

Saying Sanabi is a Katana Zero clone would be a huge disservice to this game. To me, both are exceptional gems.

But before I continue to sing my praises to this game, what exactly is Sanabi?

Well, in this action platformer game, you play as a retired veteran with a simple mission, which is to hunt an entity called ""Sanabi"". To do this, you will use your chain hook prosthetic arm to get around a city called Mago. This weapon can also be used to hook yourself to the enemies, destroying them in the process.

This grappling hook mechanism means that you will spend most of your time in the air, going from one platform to another, from one enemy to another, from one boss to another. And when done right, it feels oh so good, especially because of the tight movement. Makes you feel unstoppable, and it gets the adrenaline pumping!

I said ""when done right"", because at first, I struggled getting used to the grappling hook gameplay and gamepad controls. Because not only you can hook the enemy, you can boost yourself, slow down time, jump, and so much more. But overtime, I learned to get good and finally experienced that flow state.

Surprisingly, even with this addicting gameplay formula, my favorite part of Sanabi is still the story. Without spoiling anything, you will be confused at first because of the mysteries surrounding Sanabi and Mago are pretty complicated, but once you connect the dots, it will be mind blowing. 

At least mine did, that's for sure. It makes me want to replay the whole game instantly to see all the hints I missed.

Not only mind blowing, Sanabi's story has a lot of heart thanks to its characters. Mind you, Sanabi doesn't have too many characters, since you spend most of your time with a hacker girl named Mari, who's helping you find Sanabi, and her robot companion Mufin.

While Mari might be too talkative to some, I found her character very charming, I really enjoyed her funny personality and antics, and I think the game definitely won't be the same without Mari.

I was too invested in the story of Sanabi, the retired veteran, and Mari. By the end of the game, I was left sobbing my eyes out, heck, I instantly went to write a review, three years after I wrote my previous review.

All of these positive points, combined with the epic soundtracks and the eye catching pixel art, makes the game a complete package worth checking out, even in full price. Scratch that, I insist YOU to try out this game if you love some fast paced action gameplay and heart tugging storytelling.

With that being said, to Wonder Potion a.k.a the developers, I'll be looking forward to your future games! Doesn't matter if it will start as an Early Access product again, I WILL be there!",True,english

The story, the artstyle, the game mechanics, the world-building, and the soundtrack are all top notch. It does however get really tedious at times. It's clearly heavily inspired by Katana Zero, but where Katana Zero effortlessly succeeds in integrating an intriguing plotline with its fast-paced gameplay. This one fails; miserably at times. It felt like the cutscenes and gameplay were constantly interrupting each other, the second you get into the gameplay and are being thrown challenging enemies, you're interrupted by a cutscene twice as long, and when the story gets interesting, you're interrupted with the gameplay. At some point it was hard to enjoy the game cause there was this constant anticipation that the gameplay would come to a grinding halt with a dense cutscene.
I played the speedrun after completing the campaign, and playing it felt leagues better than story mode, the gameplay felt more connected and fluid.
The story is definitely worth experiencing but I don't think it warrants the awful gameplay to cutscene ratio. A lot of it could have been condensed, some of it could have been shown in collectables or records people who are interested could go out of their way to find, having cutscenes between longer sequences of gameplay, etc.

It's good but it would've felt so much better had it put its fast-paced gameplay front and centre, and it seems they could've easily done that.",True,english

This is a very good game, but it is certainly not a game that deserves an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" tag.  Here's why:

(1) The best part of this game is the story; there is little doubt about that. Though the story is very good, it is absolutely not original, as it is basically an exact copy of a couple very specific movies. Still, the story is worth getting through. I suggest you don't read anything about it and just go through it without any spoilers of any type, even the trailers.

(2) The problem with this ""game"" is that there is too much emphasis on the story.  You will spend significantly more time watching cut scenes and reading dialogue than actually playing.  That sounds like an exaggeration, but it is 100% true. There is LESS TIME SPENT ON GAMEPLAY THAN ON CUT SCENES. 

(3) The game took some obvious inspiration from Bionic Commando.  Swinging around is fun, but that is basically all you do.  There is little combat here and it is as simplistic as you can possibly get while still calling this a game. 

(4) It way too easy. The challenge of the game is figuring out and becoming adept with the controls.  Once you do that, you fly through the game with ease. 

Some of the reviews compare this to Katana Zero, even saying that it is better than Katana Zero.  I don't think this game is playing in the same league as Katana Zero.  Katana Zero is a far superior game. 

This could have been a legitimate classic if there was more time spent on gameplay and less on cut scenes. This game is a B.  I am not suggesting that you should not play it, as it has its fun parts, but this is really more a movie than a video game.",True,english

7/10 if I wanna be critical

I'd say this game is great if you just focus on the main parts of the game and just enjoy your time with what you have.
However, if you want to play stuff that isn't included stock... well, your wallet definitely won't be thanking you any time soon.

The music is pretty good, I'd say for every, ""Meh, it's okay,"" you'll have two, ""Dang, that's pretty good."" But to get that ""WOW"" feeling, you better cough up some of your precious dollars. This is because the songs that come with the game seem almost specifically designed to be a level or two below the paid content; not enough to really upset you, but just enough to sort of bug you. This will inevitably lead to you buying at least one of the DLC that you simply don't need. All of that knocks off a good chunk of the out-of-ten score.

If you're okay with spending money on what is, admittedly, a decent variety of songs (even if it's an objectively bad deal), then you'll have a really good experience. It's not just the songs that are better; the mapping is, too. The maps in the base-game are alright, but most of them lack a certain level of enjoyment. The DLC maps fix that, in my opinion, bringing the count of really good or enjoyable maps from 1 in 5 to 1 in 3 (or even 1 in 2). The DLC is definitely high quality from what I've seen.

But don't fret over that high price-tag as I once did. There are plenty of sales throughout each year to really enable your addiction to spending, with packs plummeting from around $30 (CAD) to just $7; sometimes, the prices can get even lower than that, so keep an eye out.

Hope this review helped someone. Thanks for reading :)",True,english

It would be great if there was a way to set the difficulty for songs played by selecting random in Freestyle.

Also, being able to queue songs after each other in Freestyle would be very nice, or maybe even a continuous mode similar to AIR but for Freestyle (i.e which keeps your scores properly).

Every penny spent on it is worth the experience. One of the first things that impressed me was how unique and distinct each theme is, with every theme having its own background music when selecting modes. Each chart has its own music video, and if it doesn’t, the game creates an original one, clearly showing the level of care and investment from the developers.

The game is frequently updated, not only adding new songs but also introducing more difficulty levels to older charts. The game features four modes: 4B, 5B, 6B, and 8B. If you want to ""get good,"" you should play every mode, starting from 4B, then progressing to 6B, and so on.

In terms of value, if you're lucky enough to buy the game and its DLCs during a sale, it’s a steal. I was able to get the full game at 80% off.

My only minor complaint is that the game doesn’t have many collaborations with other major rhythm games. While Chunithm and Muse Dash are included, I’d love to see DJMAX RESPECT V collaborate with games like maimai or SDVX and feature more Japanese artists. However, I have to admit that the game already offers a diverse range of music for everyone. I’m not a big fan of K-pop, but DJMAX changed my mind. I got to know more lesser-known Korean artists like TAK, KATOMORI, and XeoN, and I must say, I’m really addicted to their music.

Better than Risk of Rain 2 and Skul quite possibly will stay my favorite roguelite for a very long time.

Very easy to run on devices, very snappy and intuitive movement, reminds me of cuphead.

Most games like this feel too easy and I end up limiting myself to make it harder. This game, however, is challenging. Each enemy has a different way you need to approach them and level design fits them well. 

Finally, what makes this game so replayable is: 
    -each item can be used in different builds in different ways making you think about item synergy
    -heads in this game can be upgraded a surprising number of times, meaning the developers made walk cycles, unique abilities, and tons and tons of sprites that make each and every different skull and rarity of skull unique
    -when you upgrade your skull there is never a painful change in playstyle. Upgrades always compliment your already developed style of fighting

I won't say it's entirely balanced in it's mechanics (revenge is op and is practically necessary to beat the harder difficulties/some skulls just feel objectively better than others), but the way the system mechanics work with eachother and the feeling of empowerment once you find a build that hits is a dopamine rush that always hits. This is also a skill based platformer ""hack and slash"" i guess you could call it, where your skill is just as important as your build and the feeling of improvement learning how to dodge enemy attack patterns is very satisfying. 

A standard run of skul from start to finish will run you about 40 minutes (it saves every room so you can quit and come back whenever). It has a sort of maplestory vibe once you get later into the run, bigger damage numbers and crushing waves of enemies with singular spells, while still having it feel really meaty as you do just from the effort you spent getting to that point. The boss fights are also extremely challenging and it feels good to finally kill one after being stuck on it. I would say this game lands on the harder end of 2D platformers, you really need to master the mechanics to beat the end game bosses.

In this game, you play as Skul, a diminutive skeleton warrior fighting against the ""heroes"" who have invaded the Demon King's castle. The role reversal is both refreshing and entertaining.

The game's standout feature is its innovative skull-swapping mechanic. With over 90 different skulls to collect, each offering distinct playstyles and abilities, the gameplay remains fresh and engaging throughout multiple runs. This system encourages experimentation and adapts to various player preferences, whether you enjoy melee combat, ranged attacks, or magical abilities.

Visually, Skul is a treat. The pixel art style is charming and detailed, bringing the dark fantasy world to life with vibrant colors and fluid animations. The character designs are particularly noteworthy, with each skull transformation showcasing unique and often humorous personalities.

The combat is fast-paced and satisfying, with responsive controls that make navigating through hordes of enemies a joy. The difficulty curve is well-balanced, offering a challenge to seasoned players while remaining accessible to newcomers.

The roguelite elements are well-implemented, with each run feeling different thanks to the variety of skulls, items, and randomized level layouts. The permanent upgrade system provides a sense of progression that keeps you coming back for ""just one more run.""

While the story isn't the main focus, it offers enough intrigue to keep players invested, with some interesting lore tidbits scattered throughout the game.

The HD sprite artwork is fantastic, and sets a far better aesthetic standard for the series going forward than the ugly, made-for-handheld 3D models used in Dual Destines and Spirit of Justice. The collections run perfectly on both PC and Steamdeck and I've had no trouble with running them at my monitors native refresh rate and resolution (165hz/1440p). 

As for the games themselves, it's a bit more subjective but the takeaway I'd want to give is this; while the first Investigations game is only *good*, AAI2: Prosecutor's Gambit is a high point for the series not seen since the original trilogy and manages to tell a story that one could argue tops even the original game and Trials and Tribulations. If you are an Ace Attorney fan, it is truly unmissable. I'd say you could get through both games here in around 40 hours (I took my time).

For the game content, the new versions of chibi sprite are really really nice and delicate, which can definitely show the efforts of developer team. Meanwhile, the story and characters are also awesome, and Edgeworth is a better protagonist than Apollo and Athena from my point of view. I also like Shi-Long Lang very much, whose kindness towards his followers attracts me a lot. 

In general, I like AAI series more than Apollo trilogy and Great Ace Attorney series. The story of AAI2 is more interesting than AAI, but AAI is also a great game with lots of turnabouts.

Both games mix up the Ace Attorney formula a bit by not actually occurring inside the courtroom (for the most part), but in turn spice up the investigation portion by giving you the ability to actually walk around the crime scene and make deductions yourself. These games are more fast paced than other mainline entries, and I don't ever recall being particularly stuck on any investigation section unlike what happens in a few cases of other Ace Attorney games. I definitely missed the courtroom sections from other games, but you still retain the gameplay of those for the most part, since you will often listen to testimony and issue rebuttals (essentially just cross-examination). Overall, the gameplay is both familiar enough to be fun for any Ace Attorney fan, but different feeling enough to stand out from the rest.

As for story, both games have excellent cases and characters, and I would rate many cases among the best in the entire series. I definitely must say that, in my opinion at least, the second game of the collection is by far stronger in terms of both overall story and character development. I won't spoil anything specific, but the second game spends a lot of time fleshing out Edgeworth as a character as he moves through the events of the game. I'm glad that Capcom released this collection, because before this the second game was never officially translated into English, which is a crying shame. I concede that I never played the fan translation, which I have heard is excellent, but I am nonetheless glad we finally have an official release of the game outside of Japan. 

This collection is absolutely worth playing for Ace Attorney fans both for more Ace Attorney kino in general, but also the great character development we see in classic characters like Edgeworth and Gumshoe.

Each Edgeworth game could stand on its own, but both being bundled together helps them build off of each other in an enjoyable way. The first game sets up a fairly strong foundation for the second game. The second game uses callbacks and references to the first in a tasteful way.

If I had to nitpick, the second game's case #4 has disruptive pacing for its conclusion that ruins the immersion a tad.

The HD sprites and HD backgrounds are impressive, and the chibi sprites are really cute and smoother than your average animation. The UI is nice and user-friendly, and the remade sound and effects in the logic part are very cool. My favourite part of this game is being able to run around and explore, instead of being constrained to looking at one scene like in previous Ace Attorney games or Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. It just makes it more immersive, as you play the role of prosecutor/detective exploring the crime scene. Ambassador Alba is still the worst, as always, but in this game, when your health bar runs out, you can immediately load that scene again with full health instead of loading your previous save, which may have been from a long time ago.

On one hand, I do admire the original game and the rest of the two titles in the original trilogy have lots of wonderful moments as well. On the other – I’m not a fan of the ration between adventuring and visual novel storytelling they ever had, very heavily leaning into walls of text and sacrificing gameplay logic over plot twists. That’s the main reason why I stopped playing a couple of hours into The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles as it bored me to tears and I’ve never bothered with the second trilogy either. Which is why I wasn’t sure if I should give Ace Attorney Investigations Collection a go. But after playing the demo and discovering to my relief that this game, as the name implies, is far more into investigative adventuring than the other titles, I gave it a go. And I’m glad I did, as Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth is easily the most enjoyable entry in the series I’ve played. And it will probably be the last one I ever finish.

If you’re unfamiliar with Ace Attorney series, they are titles that combine light adventuring elements and visual novel-style storytelling to bring a rather unique experience of a court room drama. All the rest of the titles in the series are focused almost exclusively on said drama itself, with occasional investigative bits that are entirely linear and extremely primitive. So most of the time is spent on cross-examining someone’s testimonies in court and presenting correct evidence to highlight contradictions in them. Which, as I’ve mentioned already, involves way too much expository talking for my personal liking, as the games feel far more like barely interactive storybooks than adventure games. The original trilogy is still quite fun, especially the first game, but for all the fun twists and funny moments, the further the games went, the more they decided to sacrifice fun adventure elements in favor of guessing correct inputs to move plot forward, even if it’s not always logical. And the plot itself went from over the top and silly, to completely absurd and obnoxiously overcomplicated.

Ace Attorney Investigations breaks away from this approach. Instead of ditching the investigative part, the games (or, well, the first one at least) focuses a lot more on them, providing relatively simple, but genuinely engaging investigative gameplay where you examine the crime scenes, question the witnesses and suspects and connect clues. If you’ve played any of the titles that focus on the similar things, be it Sherlock Holmes titles, Detective Grimoire series or something like L.A. Noire, you know what to expect in general. It’s just somewhat simplified, without (at least usually) holding your hand and still providing the excitement from discovering hidden connections that may change your understanding of the case. Cross-examining testimonies is still present as well, but this time outside of the court setting and is used to bring out new information out of someone who intentionally or accidentally lied, or putting a criminal in a spot where they might reveal who they are to the surrounding crowd of witnesses, making the job of the police easier.

And given that the only game in the collection that I’ve completed is the first one (I’ll talk about the second when we get there),  I have to say that Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth is worth the purchase of the collection alone. It’s not without its flaws, for example the final case lasts way too long and becomes increasingly more absurd and convoluted as it goes. But even that one has strong moments and in general the flow of the game and its story is perfectly delivered. It makes sense, nothing feels too absurd to ruin the gameplay process, cases are interesting (even if they are way too reliant on murder) and vast majority of the logic checks are indeed logical and not of the “guess what the developer was thinking” kind. It’s better enjoyed if you do play the original trilogy of games first as some of the references and returning characters work much better with that knowledge. But it’s not like the original trilogy wasn’t worth playing on its own anyway, so you might as well do it. This isn’t Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective – that adventure game is beyond fantastic, while this one is just very very good. But it’s worth experiencing if you like investigation focused titles or like the Ace Attorney series.

Then I started playing Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit and gave up in the middle of the second case. Apart from adding a horrendous new mechanic of “mind chess”, which might be the worst “dialogue battle”-type mini-game I’ve ever experienced in my life, this title just starts with the clown makeup half-applied, and rapidly continues to become a farce by the end of the first case. It’s incredibly stupid, throws several logic-defying “logic checks” at you from the get go, makes several characters that worked so well in the previous game unbearable and then somehow keeps getting even worse as it goes. It also seems to have almost entirely decided to ditch the focus of the investigation in favor of the mind-chess and testimonies, as while investigating still happens, it takes far less time then the talking bits. So after I realized that the game is actively irritating me and doesn’t plan on stopping, I quit it and doubt that I will ever return to finish it.

That said, as I’ve already mentioned, this collection could be not a collection but just Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth and I would’ve still said that it’s worth buying. Maybe not for the full price… but I honestly can’t say that it’s not worth that price, even if you would just play one of two games. It’s a shame that the series are, in general, not really my thing. And reactions from other people to the second game that I couldn’t stomach were quite positive from the fans of the franchise… So I guess, if you’re like me, just like a good adventure game and Ace Attorney never clicked with you before – the first game in the collection might be exactly what you’re looking for. Thankfully, you can try the demo to see for yourself if you want to get it. But I’m glad that I did.",True,english

Definitely play at least games 1 and 2 of the original ace attorney trilogy first though if possible since certain character's character arcs will have already happened during those games, and so going back to them after playing these first might make those titles less enjoyable.

The good:
The characters are generally pretty lovable, with a lot of returning characters getting some form of new spin since they are interacting with Edgeworth instead of Wright. The second game alone makes the collection worth picking up. The first game gives some entertaining origin stories and is needed for context for the second game. The series also does a great job at making these entries feel like their own series and explores the characters appropriately - it stands alone incredibly well from a storytelling perspective even if many characters are reused from the original trilogy. However, definitely play at least the first two games of the original trilogy first to fully appreciate it.

The bad:
Game one is a bit slow and struggles with getting the new gameplay formula working well at times, such as where you'll figure something out and then someone shows up on the scene and requires you to explain the whole thing over to them when you just want to move on. If you can live without achievements, kind of wish I had just used story mode in game 1 for case 3 and the last half of case 5 since they drag way, way too much.",True,english

The game immerses you in a way that few can, combining its gripping story, breathtaking visuals, and impeccable soundtrack to pull you into the dystopian Night City. There were countless times where I would just stop to look around and take in the gorgeous views.

I found the blend of FPS and RPG elements to be very fun and engaging. Building up V's strength throughout the game was particularly satisfying for me, particularly in how it can interplay with the narrative, even if on the smaller side. Difficulty wise I thought it was pretty balanced overall. It does get on the easier side of things from mid to late game but I don't mind that at all. The game is limited to first person, which I didn't mind after awhile. It's an FPS after all. 
Overall, I loved the high octane, high stakes approach it takes to its combat.

I did not play this game when it first launched, so I have no idea what issues from release still remain. I can however report on the problems I did find regularly:
- Poor LOD Rendering
There were many times, particularly after installing the Phantom Liberty DLC, where the game's engine struggled a lot with loading LODs properly. I mainly noticed it with the NPCs and vehicles, especially when driving, where they would load at very low detail until you're like a few steps away. Rarely when driving, the road can just unload for some reason and become invisible for a couple seconds, which can really screw with you. This is pretty uncommon though.
- Low Traffic Density While Driving
When you're not driving around the city, the traffic is pretty normal. However, once you start going at high speeds on the road, traffic seems to diminish significantly. This does create an uncanny result considering its supposed to be a mega city. It seems the game does this to further save on resources, but it is still somewhat distracting how little traffic there can be.
- Vehicle Summoning
The game allows you to call your vehicle, and it will drive itself to you. Even to this day, the menu for this still says the feature is in beta. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any plans to properly finish it. Now, I bring this up because a lot of the time, the place that it chooses to spawn your car is..not great. Sometimes it will spawn on another road that's like a block away, and other times it spawns it in other vehicles. But on occasion, the car may straight up spawn in the air, where you can watch it gracefully tumble all the way to the ground. Other than traditional fast travel, cars and motorcycles are the de facto way to get around Night City, so a feature like this should probably have had more time in the oven.

Despite those recurring issues I had, they are nowhere near game breaking. They only hurt the already amazing immersion a bit. I did not really experience any crashes before installing mods, so those issues seem to be gone. In all, I definitely think the game is in a good place now. If you were thinking about getting Cyberpunk for yourself, I highly recommend it.",True,english

All the RPG elements you'd expect, fully voiced, great post-release maintenance/commitment and in a truly interesting non-fanstasy setting. The mechanics don't really mirror Cyberpunk 2020 or Cyberpunk: RED TTRPGs; while unfortunate, the mechanics in this game are solid.

And best of all, the game very moddable with a vibrant, engaged, and productive mod community.

Only disappointing aspect was that it has no 3rd person. You cannot see the character of the story, you cannot see their cool moves and action. Rather it's like you, the player at the computer, is there rather than the character of the story. And it wasn't immediately apparent how this weakens the whole experience.

But other than that there are only two minor points of weakness, both addressable in the mature product:
1. Boss fights assume certain style of play--the dev's preference. This is solvable by mods.
2. CDPR having their favorite story ending and putting weak effort into other endings because you should have thought like the devs and writers to get the best endgame experience [see Witcher 3]. This is solvable by research and then playing the fleshed out single ending CDPR envisioned.

Everything else is top notch, engaging, and fun. Has all the RPG elements you'd expect and good quests, decent story lines. DLC is lacking, but they did release one at least--it's also very decent; almost more interesting than the main storyline [again, see Witcher 3].

The World of Cyberpunk 2077 is a dark and gritty one. A dystopian but but also real future where you're either rich or barely surviving. but what makes this game beautiful is, despite it all, you keep fighting for a better life, never fully loosing hope even at your lowest of lows. the game shows this with not only your character but also the supporting cast. Characters who often seem hard and tuff like the city has forced them to be opening up to you and being vurnurable to you as you get to know them. Judy, Panam, heck even Johnny Silverhand. all characters who I will remember and cherish.

Now as to the gameplay when this game first came out it was, and I pardon my language, Dogshit... But ever since the 2.0 update they overhauled everything and somehow did a complete 180! With the gunplay going from feeling unimpactful and bland to OOMPHY in the best way possible and then the upgrade system acually feeling worth it with new abilities and customization to make truly unique and fun builds all of which are viable! I personaly love fully upgrading reflexes allowing me to dash and dodge around both on ground and mid-air for some really fun almost bullethell like movement or going for a more stealth build allowing you to quickly take out enemy bases and finish gigs with a quick swipe reall assassin style! just a few of the many ways to play the game and I can practically garantee that there is a playstyle for you! So much fun.

The music is also amazing and somethign I wanna highlight as a producer myself. It really perfected what Cyberpunk should sound like. It's drone like nature with these elements of punk music really fusing together in such a unique way! It just has this tensity to it that just feels suspenseful. Then there's the action music which I swear I would be so much stealthier if it didn't go as hard as it goes cuz DAMN it makes me pumped! It's so intense and adrenaline filled and fits so well to every senario! truly spectacular.
but the best tracks in the game for me are the more quiet ones. the ones that play in somber or joyful moments. the themes of the characters you meet. Johnnys theme using a cello/violin making it sound like a guitar somehow is just beautiful and really shows another side of johnny in a way. and leidmotives of ""never fade away"" (a song by Johnnys band) playing at just the right times making it almost a theme of sorts for the events that it plays in. I dunno It just adds so much to the imersion and I can't get enough of it.

And don't even get me started on the DLC. Phantom Liberty is one of the best expansions I have ever played. The district of Dogtown is dense and full of fun activities to do, but once again the highlights are the characters. Somehow they're even deeper than before, feeling like acual people who all have unique motives and personalities that when it came time to choose I couldn't decide cuz I cared so much for all of them. I wanted the best for all of them but due to the nature of the story (which i won't spoil) I could'nt and it was heartbreaking, but it also felt beautiful in a way. Just absolutly phenomenal story telling and a story I will never forget.

In the end I would personally highly recommend this game. It's a game I always come back to replay, a world that I can't get enough of and one of those games that gave me something I'll keep for the rest of my life. It might take some time to get into but trust me once ur in it will be an experience you will never forget. an experience that, despite it's dark nature, made me feel hope. A thing of beauty for sure.

and a thing of beauty will never fade away...
Keep fighting",True,english

The main story is staged in Night City, an open-world sandbox with a mix of neo-noir and ganster movie characters and narratives. While the DLC's is significantly smaller in scope, it's a tight, well written spy thriller that keeps some of the same beats (the heist elements) but remains fresh with new stakes and an interesting cast.
The RPG is well implemented: in addition to ""cyberware"" -interchangeable parts that influence your controls, movements patterns, weapon affinity and some gameplay interactions, you have 3 main variables that make for very deep character building: Attributes, Perks and Skills.
You have 5 main Attributes- each Attributes will have its own ""Perk"" tree. Raising an Attribute (up to a max of 20) will unlock more (and better) Perks. Attributes mostly have an influence on weapon proficiency and some interactions, but will also impact how you approach certain missions. Will you break the door? Can you hack the door? Can you stay hidden or will you ram through? The 3D environment of Night City helps you tackle situations with a wide variety of possible solutions.
While the ""Attributes"" can only be reset once per game, the Perks can be refunded and distributed again as many times as you wish outside combat, encouraging experimentation. You can see which weapons work best for you, how your perks interact with each other and your cybernetic implants.
The Skills progress naturally- anytime you perform an action, take down an enemy with a certain weapon, pass a dialogue or Attribute check- the related Skill will increase. Up to a max of 50, every 5 levels you will unlock a permanent boost.

I think the main downside to the game is how long it is- not all missions are created equal and sometimes it's a drag or a bit of a bore, but those moments are few and sandwiched between thrilling combat sequence. Didn't particularly care for the DB elements either.

Overall 9/10, the few narrative lapses or repetitive nature of some missions didn't spoil my fun enough to bring the score lower than that. I would just add that the soundtrack is a constant banger and is very serviceable to the story.",True,english

As an old-school Diablo 2 fan, I was skeptical, but with all the hype and seeing it on sale, I decided to give it a try. Somehow, the game sucks you in. It’s like watching grandma at the casino—every slot machine is hitting. Some of the payouts are pennies, and some are much bigger, but the idea that you might hit big or miss out on the next great item or event keeps you hooked.

There’s a lot of flash and bang, action-packed gore to keep things interesting, and plenty of ways to build your character. You can easily spend hours just sitting at your stash, or googling new ways to improve a single build. I wouldn’t say it’s the best game out there, but it definitely does the job when it comes to keeping you entertained.",True,english

I find they often ruin great games.  I eventually gave in and bought this during a trial period and really enjoyed it, so much so that I bought it, despite my grumblings against it.  Since then I've enjoyed it, despite the battle pass, which only has cosmetic rewards.  I still don't love the idea of a battle pass but the fact that the battle pass is purely cosmetic helps water it down for me.  Another thing that helps greatly is that the free tier of armor looks really amazing.  They didn't skimp on armor cosmetics to try and guide people towards buying cosmetics, which is a big plus and actually the only reason I would recommend the game.  As far as game play goes, it's been really fun.

The visuals are also quite good especially on the steam deck; which is what I buy a lot of games for since I travel a ton.

amazing.
a few bad bosses, nothing a avg person cant manage.
needs to work on the progression of the game, I feel like I cant wear a armor set that's actually cool because you unlock a new craft every 1-2 hours and most of the time they are way better than what ever armor set you crafted before that. 
the combat is great and I feel like there is a lot of build variety especially when you get some of the mythical staffs. 
the game is long and great. ~50 hours for me to beat 6 chapters, and get the true ending so :)...

After finally folding and purchasing the base game at a discount, I quickly grew to love the combat system, methods of gaining power, and especially the story the game told. The most important part of any game to me is the story, followed by the combat mechanics, then the graphics. Cyberpunk smashed all my expectations so much so that I purchased Phantom Liberty at full price when I was halfway through the game, solely because I knew I wanted more content before the end of the game. I'm very glad I did. The DLC has been wonderful, and without spoiling it, I would rate it 2 tiers above the base game (7/10 - base, 9/10 DlC, for an average of 8/10). Note that 5/10 simply means ""average"" and reasonable for the experience/price. I fully recommend the DLC if you enjoyed the base game.",True,english

1. For some reason, when the chase starts and you get hit by a car and continue driving, we did not continue. Our car got pushed to the gate and didn't move. I had to restart.
2. Then when you start fighting scavs, it's needlessly hard. It's my 2nd playthrough, on hard difficulty. On hard, I killed Adam Smasher on 2nd try at just lvl 35 with sucky cyberware, and I'd say Adam Smasher is one of the hardest bosses in the game. This thing took me 5 tries. My advice -- when you get out of car, you get blades. Forget the blades, get back to pistol, find cover and be very careful as they'll shred you very quickly. Be careful with skulls and netrunners. First time I got killed by a runner.
3. After finally doing this, I go to the ""wounded scav"" and... nothing happens. It's bugged again. Trust me, I tried everything and I don't think I did anything unusual to cause it. 

At this point I just lost it. Come on, The DLC had been out for a year now, and the base game is 4 years old at this point. I understand that making games of this scale is hard.

The dlc is its own thing pretty much with an extra ending of its own, which has the added benefit of skipping the remainder of the core vidya.

Now, onto the good things: the script, the pacing, the dialogues, the execution of a properly polished thriller. The DLC adds some extra missions for old fixers. Fetch quests aside, the quest are good too, adding depth and nuance to the NPCs. Though the most important is the selection of end-game choices you're presented with. Between wetwork, dubious loyalties and complex motivations of dramatis personaes, someone did their homework on intelligence services so a lot of it offers a very authentic experience. A lot of times you leave feeling dirty - because that is the nature of the work. My only criticism is you couldn't off Meyers (it'd be tons of fun, I think), but otherwise it's next to excellent. Johnny's dialogue at the end of the lunar escape was a rare gem, diverging from his usual abrasive rants. Meeting Mr Hands in person was somewhat of a letdown, but more gigs from the sphinxian villain was welcome.

It's difficult to believe the DLC was produced by the same studio as the cliché and filth-filled dumpster fire that is the core game. The setting remains as disgusting as ever, with humanity locked in a dull and primitive state of neo-feudal corporate overlords or communes of plain-roaming barbarians, but Phantom Liberty redeems the price tag. If you find a way to skip to the DLC and just play the extra, do it: it is a real treat for any lovers of a spy drama - something Deux Ex tried and failed to do.

Imagine if James Bond, Keanu Reeves, and Idris Elba decided to throw a party in Night City, and you get to clean up the mess. That’s Phantom Liberty for you.

The expansion kicks off with the President of the New United States crash-landing in Dogtown. Yes, you read that right. Apparently, Air Force One now comes with a “crash here for plot development” button. You’re hired to rescue her, but not before you navigate through a maze of cybernetic baddies, morally ambiguous choices, and enough plot twists to make a pretzel jealous.

Idris Elba’s character, Solomon Reed, is the secret agent we all wish we could be. He’s suave, he’s mysterious, and he probably has a better skincare routine than you. Meanwhile, Keanu Reeves returns as Johnny Silverhand, still rocking that “I hate the system” vibe but with a touch more existential dread. It’s like watching your cool uncle go through a mid-life crisis, but with more explosions.

Dogtown itself is a marvel. It’s like someone took all the worst parts of a dystopian future and decided to make it a tourist attraction. The local wildlife includes cyber-enhanced gangsters and vending machines that might just try to sell you a grenade. But hey, at least the street food is to die for—literally.

The gameplay is a rollercoaster of emotions. One moment you’re making life-or-death decisions, the next you’re wondering why your character’s pants have suddenly disappeared. It’s all part of the Cyberpunk experience, folks. Embrace the chaos.

In conclusion, Phantom Liberty is the perfect blend of high-stakes drama, cybernetic mayhem, and unintentional comedy. It’s like a soap opera set in a dystopian future, and honestly, we wouldn’t have it any other way. So, grab your cyberdeck, put on your best trench coat, and dive into the madness.

When [b]Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth (LADIW)[/b] first trailer came out, I was really looking forward to coming back to the turn-based JRPG gameplay that the game was going for. I was really excited to what the game improved on with [b]Y7[/b] and what new features that the game had in store for it. With that said, this review will also be a bit hard for me to cover in certain aspects, as I don’t want to spoil anything on the game.

[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]
[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
[*]A very interestingly crafted story with fun characters
[*]Fun turn-based gameplay
[*]Unique jobs that can give you a variety of moves
[*]Lots of side content to do in the game
[*]Fantastic soundtrack that is nice to listen to
[*]Beautiful graphics that make the areas feel alive
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
[*]The story loses some of its charm near the end
[*]New Game+ and other difficulties locked behind a DLC
[/list]

[h1]Story[/h1]
[b]Ichiban Kasuga[/b] was working at an average job until he one day gets let go from his and cancled by a [b[Vtuber[/b] on in one day. This is due to a callout video made by a [b]Vtuber[/b] named [b]Hisoka Tatara[/b] and because of this [b]Kasuga[/b], with his two friends, [b]Nanba and Adachi[/b], decide to go to the [b]Seiryu clan[/b], to find answers. Along their way, they meet ex-yakuza members and meet [b]Jo Sawashiro[/b], who then tells [b]Kasuga[/b] to go to [b]Hawill[/b] and find his mother. Although there is a lot more going on then one may seem.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3333939084
The story for [b]LADIW[/b] is pretty good, I really loved the new characters and the returning ones were also nice. I honesty think even telling one of my favorite characters is spoiling the story too much, besides [b]Tomizawa[/b], who is a cab driver and was just a cool character. The story has that classic crime drama that the series is known for.

However, the story does lose some of its charm near the end of the game, as it falls off a tad bit although this is only a minor issue that I noticed. Everything else with the story is great but near the end, it kind of just goes away, although they do leave off with an interesting note for it’s next game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
[b]LADIW’s[/b] gameplay mainly remains the same from the previous entry but there are some changes that I really loved that the game added. Besides [b]Kasuga[/b], everyone will now pick up objects to attack people if they are near them. So if you ever wanted to see [b]Nanba[/b] throw a bike at someone, well now you can. You can also use MP to cast special moves to deal more damage, buff/debuff someone, or heal. Overall, the gameplay is very fun and your characters can learn lots of moves to help them in combat.

During combat, you can also time the enemy's attacks so you can block them to do less damage. One of the newest things to combat for enemies is that they can be in a guard state, when they are in this, they will take reduced damage. To get them out of the guard state mainly, you have to use a grab attack, in which they will be taken out of that state. Your teammates also have a radius on their attacks, they can attack any enemy at any range but if they stay in the radius, they will do extra damage on that attack.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3333941765
Jobs are back as well and there are some unique ones that are with each party member. This time around, all the jobs in this game are very good and there isn’t one that is bad necessarily. However, there are some jobs that are ok for the most part but aren’t bad, it is up to personal preference but I never really came across a bad job in this game for any character. Especially [b]Joongi Han or Seonhee[/b] where their main jobs were just straight up broken.

If you want to switch jobs but keep a certain move, you can do it with a move transfer feature that the game has. Which is very useful to create the ultimate character with the best job with some of the best moves in another job. Although you can only do up to five moves in total completely. So make sure you have the moves that you want to use and keep note of them so you can make the most of them.

There is a ton of side content that the game has in it and some very interesting ones at that. The first one I would like to bring up is [b]Sujimon[/b], which is this game's version of [b]Pokemon[/b], where you battle [b]Sujimon[/b] trainers and challenge gym leaders. Then there is [b]Dondoko Island[/b], where you manage a hotel resort, it’s like [b]Animal Crossing[/b] to an extent. So as you can see, You have three games in one, [b]Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth, Pokemon, and Animal Crossing[/b]. There is a lot to the gameplay that I have not explained but I can’t fit it all into this review, I do talk a little more about this game in my video on it (will be out soon, ran into some problems}. I also rated all the [b]Yakuza[/b] games that I have played so if you are interested in that, keep an eye out for it.

Although despite having all of this great stuff in this game, [b]Infinite Wealth[/b] has one glaring issue with its gameplay or the game as a whole. New Game+, is locked behind a DLC and so is hard mode, in other words, you only have access to one difficulty for the game. The game isn’t that hard either but the fact that a basic game feature is locked behind a DLC just proves [b]Sega’s[/b] greed.

[h1]Graphics, Performance and Soundtrack[/h1]
The graphics for this game are beautiful and I loved how the world that you are in is detailed, each area felt real and it’s like I was in its world. I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM, I had no issues while I was playing and I was able to play it just fine, on medium settings.
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3333942218
The soundtrack for this game is just fantastic and it even rivals Y0’s soundtrack, my favorite songs in the game are [b]Camouflage, Barracuda, and Giftiger Füllhalter[/b]. These songs just sound so damn nice to listen to and I highly recommend you check them out when given the chance.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
[b]Infinite Wealth[/b] is one of the best games that I have played this year and I am glad I was able to experience it in all its glory. I recommend this game to all [b]Yakuza[/b] fans, especially for those who enjoyed [b]Y7[/b]. You will have a great time with this game and the side content will make sure you are hooked and are playing the game for hours on end.

Three words that fit this game perfectly. There is nothing more infuriating then trying to get on with a game's story just to be thrown into a forced animal crossing bootleg tutorial. The game's story (when it isn't extremely predictable or being hindered by endless filler) is pretty good and I want to see more of it, so it's a shame that you have to trudge through sneaking through crowded streets of enemies for an hour to get to it. It got to the point where I just had to go on WeMod and turn on stealth mode. This game could have been great, but since the seventh entry they've really dropped the ball with the franchise.
Also Ichiban is not a good character. Having a character obnoxiously looking for the good in horrid people doesn't make him a good guy, it makes him stupid, and no matter how hard you try to push this ""him and Kiryu are so alike"" point it will never make it true. ",False,english

Strongly recommendation! 
The Hawaii map is incredible! Initially I didn't like Ichiban san as the new main character in 7, however it's just the optimism and full of justice of Ichiban san, which made the whole story more interesting and lively!

One of the greatest and most jam-packed RPGs of all time from the legends at RGG. They never cease to amaze me with the quality of the games they put out.

While the story overall feels a bit drawn out, there were countless tear-jerking moments as usual. The combination and differing playstyles of Kiryu and Ichiban make the combat refreshing and I especially love that they put the classic arcade fighting style in Kiryu's playset. Amazing stuff.

At a whopping 127 hours by Steam playtime, Infinite Wealth is now the longest game I've ever played by a huge margin. It took me nearly 40 hours longer than its predecessor, and over 30 hours longer than it took to earn a platinum trophy in Persona 5 Royal. Whatever else you want to say about this game, you can't say that you're not getting your money's worth. The bigger question is whether this incredible level of time investment is worth it. Although this is in many ways a great game, it's harder than I'd like to say that it was 127 hours well spent. 

Let's start with the good news. The main story is well done, and you could probably get through it in a relatively normal amount of time for a JRPG if you're focused on it. It has some fun fights and a lot of callbacks that I'm sure are exciting and rewarding content if you've played Yakuza 0-6. The new characters are deeply integrated into the plot and have satisfying arcs. Honolulu is a fun city to explore and feels as different from Ijincho as you'd expect.

A lot of the other things that were good in the last game remain fun. The battle system is still great, and made more so by new jobs. The music is great. There are some entertaining side quests, the minigames are gloriously stupid, and so on. You'd expect at least a few things that are horribly underdeveloped in a game this long, but everything is basically fine at a minimum. 

The bad news is that while nothing truly feels incomplete, many parts of the game would have benefited from more refinement. Although the minigames are fun, there are only a handful of new ones and there's nothing as crazy as kart racing or running a public company from the last game. Most of them, like the parodies of Crazy Taxi and Pokemon Snap are solid experiences that run out of new content after 20 minutes and don't have worthwhile rewards. The highlights are supposed to be Donodoko Island and Sujimon battling, which parody Animal Crossing and Pokemon respectively, but neither of them have the depth to reach their full potential. Dondoko island boils down to spamming buildings all over your island until you get the next cutscene, and Sujimon battling is almost entirely determined by who has the best rarity Sujimon at the highest level. Since each Sujimon only has one move and all moves do pretty much the same thing with different damage totals, there's little reason to anything other than mash A and occasionally swap for type matchups. You need to complete Dondoko Island and the Sujimon league if you want to complete all the quests, but they're each long enough that you could have finished an entirely different game instead. That was one thing in the last game when the minigames were as fun as many other full games, but in this case it really didn't feel worth the time. 

Sadly, the minigames aren't the only place where you get the feeling that the devs didn't get all the time they needed. The story rushes to make sure every major character returns, but several of them clearly have no reason to be back and barely play any role other than being present. The final battles at the end of the game are well made and difficult, but the evil monologues you're treated to reveal that the villains never really had any kind of coherent plan, which makes you wonder what the point of it all was and whether there was supposed to be more content that would have tied everything together better. It's all capped off by one of the main party characters not even being present for the epilogue and instead just getting a single sentence to explain what happened. It's not quite ""and then everybody died, the end"", but it's hard to imagine an explanation other than not having time to make another epilogue cutscene. 

At the end of the day, Infinite Wealth is a great game that just tries to do too much. RGG wanted to have a sendoff for Kiryu while also telling a new story on the scale of the last game, and they really should have picked one or the other. Although they do a better job of integrating those two very disparate goals than you might expect, trying to cram all of that into a game with anything resembling a normal runtime just means that nothing gets the time it deserved. It's still a good game, but I can't help but wonder if it would have been better as two separate games that each had a single goal. If nothing else, that would have prevented the need to break the cast up into two small parties and given you more flexibility to build your battle team.

I know some fans of the Yakuza series have criticized parts of this game's story, and understandably so, but this game more than makes up for it. Hawaii as a setting for Ichiban and his pals works so well it seems like they've always been there. Every single part of the map is blooming with beautiful sights to see, and fun things to do. From the main story, to the side quests, to the many alternate game modes, this game never stops entertaining you. The story for this game is it's most divisive part, and for me it was my favorite part. I was an orphan myself, and the fact that a huge portion of Ichiban's story in this game was getting to see his birth-mother again was a beautiful thing that every adopted child wishes they could do. The scenes with Ichiban reminiscing on his family and what could have been felt like things that have gone through my head a hundred times. Kiryu's story was also somber. With our favorite dragon now having cancer, he can't fight like he used to. He learns to rely on his friends, which is a lesson everybody needs to learn eventually. The finale for both of these incredible characters fit perfectly within their themes, and it ends in an extremely satisfying way. The new characters are also fantastic. Chitose, Tomizawa, and Yamai are all realistic characters with interesting backstories and they fit right in with all of our favorites. The combat here is also a massive step-up from Yakuza 7. We now have movement options within the fights, which make planning and executing your moves that much more strategic. Add in an insane number of jobs, and you have a combat system that's fun all the way through. This game has so much to offer to so many different types of people, and that's why the Yakuza franchise is so incredible. Please play this game. You won't regret it.",True,english

Although unlike Dark Souls parrying is basically required just like Sekiro except the timing is a bit harder. Although I am a Souls veteran, I struggled immensely on the first somewhat challenging boss because it was pretty much a test of how well you could parry as simply whiff punishing between his attacks did very little damage. So parrying was the only way to get big damage by breaking his posture and riposting him. Once you master that, you've ""gotten good"" at LoP. There is also the rally system from Bloodborne, which just lets you regain most of the damage taken from blocking if you attack the opponent a few times after. The overall game has the same amount of polish as FromSoftware games, though it has a surprising amount of DNA from Code Vein in the sound and visual effects, and some mechanics like sliding down ladders and interacting with more things at your home base.

The first part of this review is for the general game, the second part is the threshold where I accepted it wasn't worth continuing.

Pros:
1.  The Legion arm mechanic is pretty cool.  Essentially preset secondary equipments that can be upgraded to add new passives to them.  Examples include a staggering grapple hook, a charge up electric blast, a landmine summoner, and a a retaliatory shield.  Legion arms allow you to get a boost against harder foes that your weapon proves insufficient for.
2.  Parry mechanics.  Depending on what kind of enemy your fighting, a perfect parry will either help stagger them for a combo hit or help shatter their weapon, reducing attack variety and damage.
3.  Specters act as boss assists if you're frustrated or unable to defeat a boss.  It's a pretty big help if your too frustrated.

Cons:
1.  Underwhelming soundtrack.  The only music in the game outside of the gramophone is against bosses, and they all sound pretty similar.
2.  Finite resources.  There's only one copy of each weapon, armor, and amulet, with no way to get more.  If you sold or missed an item, it's gone forever, the entire playthrough.  Quartz, the skilltree material, can't even cover half the skilltree without running out for the rest of the playthrough.  Cranks, allowing you to tinker with weapon scaling, are also finite, discouraging experimentation.  Consumables have to be slowly grinded for until chapter 5 when you can buy them.
3.  Rushed choices.  Any time the game has you make a narrative choice, it gives you about 6 seconds before automatically selecting whatever your cursor touched last, leaving no time to think anything through.  This leads to decisions feeling incoherent and shallow.
4.  Lack of information.  The game doesn't tell you what three of your six stats even do, making the early game confusing.  Status effects only tell you what they do once they've killed you.

Last part of my review is unfairness.  Up until Elysian Boulevard, the game does quite well with dying being your fault rather than cheap shots or instant death.  Once you reach the boss there, you have your first instance of simply full on stun locking you with no escape method.  Once you trudge your way through that, you soon hit the swamp monster, with the ability to also kill you in one inescapable combo, but with the addition of being far too durable to kill with consumables and shredding your specter.  Outside of bosses, several things lead to being unfair.  Several points have enemy locations that you can't reasonably deal with, leading to barely avoidable damage.

Keep in mind that this is my first souls like, so I can't compare it well to others.  I do enjoy difficult games such as Dead Cells and Celeste, but difficult and unfair are rather different things.",False,english

This game compared to most Souls-like games has given the most care out of any games I have seen. Not many games give an equal fairness into their mechanics besides this one. Every other souls-like game I have played has never given me much satisfaction compared to this one either. The story, the combat, the variety of combat weapons, and the goddamn level design and setting of the game just comes out as one of my Top 10 games of all time.

I own Elden Ring, but I never completed it because I got too lost in its open-world concept. However, this game was an amazing introduction to the genre, especially considering it comes from a smaller studio, not a massive corporation.

The story is captivating, and the game does a great job guiding you through it. The voice acting is absolutely incredible—most games have at least a bit of cringe in their dialogue, but not this one. The performances are top-notch.

Combat is really fun and rewarding. Parrying can break enemies' weapons, and you can combine different weapons and handles (I mostly used boss weapons throughout the game). I didn’t find the game overly difficult either—you can even beat some bosses with throwable items, and certain bosses allow you to summon an aid, which is super helpful.

The music is also insane. It’s one of the highlights of the game for sure. After beating it, I immediately wanted to start another playthrough, but I’ve heard that DLC and a sequel have been announced, so I’m waiting for that. When the DLC drops, I’m definitely doing another run with a new weapon setup.

Great story. Mostly great game. 3 of the bosses try hard to ruin it.

Given the fact that this is a game built almost entirely on parrying, it's frustrating when you can't stop a chain of actions to parry or dodge. Also any hit seems to slightly stagger P. For a split second you can't move and for just slightly longer you can't parry or dodge. Not a problem for most of the game, but for the very fast bosses chaining attacks, it's annoying you can see P not reacting to your input as another attack comes in. Yet for the most part, your attacks don't have the same effect.

There are minor issues with it such as bosses that jump very high in the air, yet the camera angle cannot look straight up. In some places it's like ledges are covered in grease. It's possible to be pinned against a wall or object by an enemy and have no way out, it's effectively a death sentence with certain enemies.

*Minor spoilers*
Most of the bosses are fun with good cut scenes.
3 of them are not fun. The King of Puppets, Laxasia and the Nameless puppet.
There is clearly a reason the achievement % drops off at each of these.
The times I beat them, it was luck of the draw of how aggressive the boss was feeling that round.

Sometimes it feels like that game goes out of it's way to kill you if you do ""too well"" and get close to killing the boss quickly in the first few rounds. You'll soon be punished with an onslaught. Yet if you just stand there and practice parrying, you don't get the same intense beating.

For the fights with the spectre, for me just using a single HP re-gen wish on it worked well to keep the boss distracted for longer. Other wishes are okay, but nowhere near as impactful as simply having two of you in the battle for longer.

Save throwing items until you have the boss down to <10% health, then use them to help finish it quick. Otherwise don't bother using them, they're effectively a limited resource before you'll have to go out farming for them. 

I beat each of the above 3 by using fable arts and throwables in those last few moments.",True,english

Lies of P is an intense souls-like that nails the creepy vibe with twisted, puppet-filled streets, and a narrative that’s surprisingly gripping.

The combat feels fluid and satisfying, punishing you just enough to make each victory feel earned. The twist? You're a puppet whose lies shape the story and the outcome—so keep your nose (and blade) sharp. It's a fresh spin on familiar mechanics with a gothic charm that'll keep you hooked, even when you're rage-quitting... for the 10th time.",True,english

Lies of P sees you lead as Gepetto's puppet in a twisted, gloomy take on the folktale of Pinocchio. Waking up in an eerie train station, you soon make your way outside to the city of Krat, where a sudden trigger in the puppets causes a haunting massacre that sets the tone for the rest of the game.

     On that note, atmosphere is the name. Hotel Krat is your central hub, and it quickly evolved from being a brief trip to level up my weapons into a safe retreat where I could listen to a vibrant soundtrack in the background as I spoke with the many charismatic faces that made up this iconic location. It's not just the hub area - everything from oil-lined streets to infested cathedrals, the immense amount of detail present within the level design itself across most of the chapters is incredibly impressive. Whether it was my first playthrough or my sixth, I could not help but immerse myself in all of the intricately placed bodies & texts around the city that truly cements this game as an all-time example of how to do proper environmental storytelling within linear experiences. Neowiz and Round8 really wear the inspiration on their sleeves with the worldbuilding here and it's very well executed. (Note: it runs flawlessly for me on an upper-end rig, but even on my steam deck it is the best performing game I own. It's also very nicely balanced and well-paced. I would say I preferred the difficulty around launch, as it really heightened my enjoyment of this game in a unique way because of how challenging it was. But it's still a decent challenge and NG+ definitely brought that difficulty back.) 

     Combat is really where Lies of P hits all of its strides for me. As a fan of FromSoftware's 'soulsborne' entries for the better part of a decade, I believe Lies of P implements so many positive spins on their formula that I would recommend this over the traditional souls games to any player, regardless of experience (well... maybe play Sekiro.) For example, one of my favorite mechanics is pulse recharge, which allows you to gain one more charge to your healing consumable if you are at zero. This feature would change the entire dynamic of so many of my fights in an instant. Maybe I'm playing defensively, I've got two more heals and 60% of the boss's health left; in scenarios like this, every single time I reached zero heals, my brain would switch to aggression immediately in the hopes of regaining a charge and feel more 'comfortable.' I cannot speak to everyone's experience, but this mechanic made me a better player over time as I was PUSHED into being more active in my gameplay and subsequently rewarded with the most satisfying sound effect I've heard since the Halo CE shield recharge as a single pulse cell materializes right back into your upper belt. 

     Another great feature to the combat sandbox is the ability to assemble weapons. This is the single-most innovative design choice that Lies of P offers. Every weapon comes in two distinct parts, the blade tip and the handle. Each part has their respective stats; however, you can alter the handle to scale off of different stats than the ones it drops with. This opens up a lot of customization and encourages player experimentation, because at no extra-cost, your entire moveset and ability options can change in a matter of seconds. I myself am a Guts sword girl through and through, but even I felt compelled to experiment and eventually beat the game with my own ridiculous combinations. (Note: For me, this self-expression was VERY important in my enjoyment of the game, and I think it's a great innovation to the souls combat formula to allow your players to test out ANY weapon handle's moveset with... every other weapon's blade. Admittedly boss weapons are restricted from being customized and the scaling of both parts' stab/slash stat means that your options for good damage are inherently limited, but it offers so much freedom regardless that I would not mind seeing it return in the sequel.) 

     Story is the point I want to end this off on. For as long as I have cherished Bloodborne's lore, the original trilogy's lore, etc. I have never actually felt connected to the events of the stories presented in souls-like games. There's always been a strange disconnect for me being able to enjoy the challenge of the gameplay rather than caring about the story. I can say Lies of P genuinely moved me in a way no other games in this subgenre have. I believe the most obvious explanation for this is the greater emphasis on dialogue and player onboarding that Lies of P engages in. There is a real sense here with the amount of dialogue you'll receive from a character off-screen during gameplay or in the middle of a boss fight that Neowiz really wanted to make players feel INVOLVED in the big character moments as they are happening, rather than reading about them from a lore description (which is also a method of storytelling present with a lot to read up on that is engaging.) To be clear, I have no issue with this, but I really prefer the focus on character engaging with me, the truths/lies you decide to tell them, and the almost-immediate consequences those decisions can have as they relay their reactions back to you. You can ignore or fight multiple bosses by making a simple decision. I like that. The narrative throughline that is happening above all of the character stories is decently executed, but the character quests is really where Lies of P shines (shoutout to Arlecchino.) Everyone is voice acted phenomenally, and this could not be a Lies of P review without making mention of how pivotal this game's original soundtrack is to the overall experience. The music feels tied to the characters' stories, as many records you can play back at Hotel Krat are received from quest completions. This makes even something as seemingly trivial as playing a record on a record player feel rewarding in itself, as you learn more about an NPC's journey through this world or simply enjoy a great tune in the background. 

     This has become my comfort game, and affectionately so. That doesn't mean it is devoid of things I disliked, as the final area of the game, Arche Abbey, has got to be the single-most tedious level I have played in recent memory. Running through this moody grey wasteland to a grey tower with grey floors and repeated enemies from throughout the entire game got tiring incredibly fast, and it's a shame that the area with this game's pinnacle challenges is also so uninspired in its design. Additionally, I do not think the armor system, dubbed ""Defense parts,"" is particularly exciting. I think this could be fleshed out a little more, but finding more parts throughout the game is almost never exciting because they are always going to be better than your previous find, and they do not change any part of your puppet's appearance. I do like the cosmetics available here, but I definitely prefer the more free-form style of armor expression in other souls-likes. The legion arm system is probably the most disappointing aspect for me, delivering options to customize your limb similar to the prosthetic tools in Sekiro. I do not like the implementation in this game because it feels stiff to me. This is not something I have the knowledge to explain away, but it feels very restricted and with the low amount of legion I always have, it just left a lot to be desired for me because I mainly relied on parrying and counterattacking. 

     Despite my negatives, I adore this game. At the time of writing I have unlocked everything pre-DLC and waiting in anticipation for it as well as the recently announced sequel. If you've ever got a weekend to knockout a surprisingly compelling souls-like, this is absolutely the one for you.",True,english

Combat is fast-paced and has a bit of a learning curve, but is extremely satisfying once it clicks. Learning when to parry vs block, attack with a weapon vs throwbacks vs weapon art was fun and engaging. 

It also looks great and runs smoothly. Even on the Steam Deck with decent graphic settings, I was easily keeping 60 FPS.

Some people have criticized it for not being as open world as a game like Elden Ring, but I see that as a positive aspect of Lies of P. Being able to have a more linear path made the gameplay tight and paced well. It also never felt like it overstayed it's welcome, like I wind up feeling about many open world games.

This is the only game I've ever been motivated to 100% and can't wait for the DLC and sequel.

I'm recommending and warning you against buying this game at the same time.

You have the problems - the game's approach to puzzles is literally insulting to your intelligence. Every time you encounter a puzzle, the companion you're with tells you how to solve it before you even have a chance to take a look around. ""Hey, maybe that thing above you is gonna open a pathway"" and that's literally every puzzle in the game. This should be an accessibility option, you should be able to shut your companions up when you're trying to solve the already trivial puzzles. Sure the combat is still nice, story is nice, but this? Its insulting. Not a single puzzle goes without your companion telling you exactly how to solve it. ""Woow, what if we freeze this?"" and the moment you try anything, they will say something like ""oh no maybe lets try something else"" or ""oh yes we did it"" to indicate the correct solution which they already gave to you to begin with.

LOOK HERE    ---->    The PSN drama isn't as bad here as it was with helldivers, since in helldivers you could buy and play the game for like 3 months before they made it impossible to play for some regions. Here on the other hand you had warnings of the PSN requirement from the very start. Is it okay to have mandatory PSN requirements for a PC version of a single player game? 
Definitely a garbage decision which is clearly one of the biggest flaws of the newer games to come out. Some regions will require you to link a phone number to check your age, I think it is the case for the UK. The other ones will ask for your postal code and real name - it's all going to a third party website which is KNOWN for losing your data to frequent data leaks and hacks. Obviously PSN doesn't care whether you own or even intend to own a PS5 for this, you still need the account because they want to collect more data, it's as simple as this.

Having said that, I think the game itself is great, the unlocked framerate makes it even smoother to play to be honest. Then on the other hand, if you're not okay with this invasion on your personal data security, maybe rethink purchasing it. Same applies to some specific regions of the world which require even more data than other regions. I really suggest you look it up before you buy the game.

TLDR: PSN bad, game doesn't respect your intelligence with insane amounts of handholding but good story and good gameplay overall. Not goty but buy this if you can overlook the PSN drama.",True,english

Beyond well optimized. Its easily one of my favorite games to play right now.

Aside from running well, this game has been everything I wanted it to be and then some. Compared to the vibe of original FF7, I think this does it a lot of justice. The characters and dialogue are fun, the Shinra menace is equally pronounced etc.

The combat is so smooth I don't even know where to start. But somehow they made a turn-based FF game feel completely naturally FF in an action RPG environment. It's great.

The pacing is good, the side quests are cute and rewarding. I feel like I wasn't wasting much time if any in this game. Everything just sorta flows when you figure out the map.

I can praise this game all day. I'm on the last chapter as of today - I only have a few issues:

-The humor can be out of place sometimes along with the fan service. Particularly when you hear Tifa say 'Man I really need a shower' for the 40th time after a fight it sorta makes you raise an eyebrow, genuinely. That crap is NOT why I'm here and it's sad to me that these adults designing these games find it adds anything to this kinda game.

-I get there is world building and the game GENUINELY at times feels like a re-imagined PS1 game but at times I feel like I'm running down long hallways for no real reason. Are the narrow passages you have to side-step through like...loading screens? Some places are just too big dude. 

-Collect-a-thon. As much as I like that and enjoy it in FF games, this game goes a little too far with the ground clutter. Way too many boxes to destroy. Personally I prefer ~80% of my items to be bought/earned from fights but I'd reckon 70-80% of your important items are in yellow-lit boxes and the battle rewards are mostly for gil. Is what it is. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I would probably enjoy *an hour or 2* Less destroying boxes on the ground.",True,english

There are pros and cons for someone like myself. I love the graphics and how they've been redone. I love the voices given to the characters. I love how interactive the game is, and it doesn't have to cut to a ""movie"" scene as in previous Final Fantasy games. I don't mind the slight change in the leveling/batting system. It feels more fluid, yet I can access the menu to choose what I want to do for the character I'm controlling. Is it complete control over all the characters with ATB? No. However, for this remake, it feels right. Moving onto changes in the story. There are a lot I agree with, and it was nice to have a change. However, I also felt a lot didn't need a change.

- Combat gets interruped every five second because camera gotta zoom on enemy charging attack.
- Knockbacks are insane every time you get close they knock you back and they can lead to combos just becouse.
- Even if you manage to hit enemy they just automatically counter deal damage to you and send you away again.
- Party members are awful they do just bare minimum, they live long enough just becouse enemy mostly targets only character currenty controlled by player.(Also same useless character blows in next cinematic fifty ton boulder with lightning. That just makes me scream.)
- Dodge got no i frames it only avoids aoe and projectiles in melee vs bosses is pretty much useless.
- Attacks cannot be cancelled probably biggest turnback issue i have no idea why but we can only watch next three seconds getting hit and have no other option.
- I did it in second try and the WORST thing is i dont even know how..

Fans of the original will be pleased with just about everything barring the combat, which you'll either love or hate. The move away from turn-based has been divisive amongst FF fans and while I think it's done well sometimes (like here) and done poorly in others (like FF15, which feels clunky and often time tedious), I do still miss it somewhat.

The PC port is quite polished now and supports HDR, so maxed out it looks like how the original FMVs looked in my kid mind playing OG.

Decent amount of replayability to go through hard mode and find other content, but being the first part of a 3-part epic you could breeze through it and be left wanting more.

The meat of the game isn't the campaign(s), it's ""Immortal Empires"" the game mode that brings all games together. However I do hope one day they do make a final campaign or even a game mode where it's the forces of ""good"" vs ""Evil"" working together.

This game is hard, like vary hard, if you are new you will die a lot to older players.  So here are a few things you can do to get better at the game.

1. Don't cheat.  You will not get better if you do cheat and you will make the game worse by doing so.
2. Listen to your surroundings.  This can make you win or loss a game just because you could not hear where the other players shots are coming from so you put your back towards the player shooting at you instead of facing them.
3. Do not land at popular sites, this is an easy and fast way to go back to the lobby, instead look for locations at least 1km from where the plane is flying and go there.
4. Play with friends and use VOIP.  You can use the in game VOIP, but what I use is Discord.
5. Don't go more then 100 m from your team mates.  This way when one of you is in trouble, 3 of your team mates are at positions to aid you.  Also don't be to close to each other, as this makes you easier to spot and makes it harder for you and your team mates to return fire when you are in a fire fight.
6. When you see someone, ping them so your team mates know where they are and can aid it taking them down.
7. Take a automatic weapon and a long range weapon (DMR or SR).  My suggestion for a new player is a SMG and a DMR.  For SMG use one of the 3, UMP, VECTOR, MP5K.  As for DMR's, use SLR or DRAGUNOV.
8. Carry at least 4 First Aid kits, 10 bandages, and 4 boosts.
9. Carry 2-3 Smoke grenades.
10. Just have fun.

EA FC 25 has become much more than just a football simulation game—it’s an obsession for many, almost to the point of addiction. The game’s allure lies not only in its realistic gameplay but in the psychological hooks embedded within its most popular mode, Ultimate Team. Here, players build their dream squads by purchasing and opening virtual packs, hoping to land high-rated players. The randomness of the pack openings, combined with the constant updates of new content and challenges, can feel like a never-ending cycle, which easily mirrors the addictive behaviors seen in gambling. Spending real money on virtual packs in EA FC 25 often feels like buying lottery tickets, with the dopamine rush from landing a rare player driving players to keep spending, hoping for better results next time. This practice has been widely criticized for promoting gambling habits, particularly among younger players, who might not fully grasp the financial consequences.

Personally, EA FC 25 triggers a unique frustration. Despite investing hours into perfecting skills, tweaking formations, and optimizing my Ultimate Team, the game often feels unfair. Matches can be decided by tiny, sometimes random moments—an AI glitch, a poor refereeing decision, or a lucky bounce—leaving me feeling powerless. What makes it worse is when the players you worked so hard (or spent so much) to acquire seem to underperform, leading to pure rage. The gameplay mechanics sometimes feel deliberately designed to push you into spending more, as if the better players you need to succeed are always just out of reach, unless you're willing to pay. This cycle of frustration, combined with the temptation of opening ""just one more pack,"" turns what should be a fun experience into something more stressful and, at times, toxic. The game manages to tap into that part of your brain that makes you feel like you’re on the verge of a breakthrough, but in reality, it’s pulling you deeper into the grind, causing more frustration and emotional investment than it should.",False,english

As an old-school Diablo 2 fan, I was skeptical, but with all the hype and seeing it on sale, I decided to give it a try. Somehow, the game sucks you in. It’s like watching grandma at the casino—every slot machine is hitting. Some of the payouts are pennies, and some are much bigger, but the idea that you might hit big or miss out on the next great item or event keeps you hooked.

There’s a lot of flash and bang, action-packed gore to keep things interesting, and plenty of ways to build your character. You can easily spend hours just sitting at your stash, or googling new ways to improve a single build. I wouldn’t say it’s the best game out there, but it definitely does the job when it comes to keeping you entertained.",True,english

Since then I've enjoyed it, despite the battle pass, which only has cosmetic rewards.  I still don't love the idea of a battle pass but the fact that the battle pass is purely cosmetic helps water it down for me.  Another thing that helps greatly is that the free tier of armor looks really amazing.  They didn't skimp on armor cosmetics to try and guide people towards buying cosmetics, which is a big plus and actually the only reason I would recommend the game.

My very low end computer has some trouble running the game, nonetheless I will not say that adds any negative remarks on the game; I made a poor investment for gaming. Luckily I have friends who let me play on their consoles and experience the game.

The Story is not over bearing with characters speech that adds nothing to the game. A casual gamer looking for a couch co-op game can jump into the story and understand the general idea of what is happening and enjoy the story. Furthermore, someone who is decently well versed in the grim dark universe will appreciate characters building upon the setting and making the player feel as if they are apart of a multi planet defense against heretical xenos.

The game play is not exactly casual, offering a challenge to players that can be overcome with most any game play style chosen. The game brings back a hack and slash, co-op gamer missed by many of gamers. The combat is executed in a cinematic world built with care to detail, with brutal combat and satisfying finishers.

The game is very well made, extremely well polished compared to the standards upheld by the AAA studios of today and deserves a try if you are in the right place to pick up a new game and spend more hours then you think dedicated to the game.",True,english

But it shows that Konami wants to get away from the recycle-old-game-and-stick-a-new-name-on scheme. Some ideas and approaches are very good (more movements without the ball, cross-play, transitionless corners and throw-ins, etc...), but the implementation is very miserable. To be honest, even old functions that have always worked flawlessly are miserable now. In the end, this just shows how hard it actually is to bring a completely new game to market instead of remarketing the same game for full price. I like the approach of putting more effort into the football games, bringing new features and taking risks. It's a shame that PES flopped this year, but since it's free, you shouldn't bitch so much. Kudos to Konami for daring to make this right step. I'll wait for EFootball until it's ready.

Edit.

The updated version of EFootball is not comparable to the beta version which was very criticized. The game runs very smoothly and I hardly had any bugs, the graphics and animations look very realistic especially on high graphics settings. The game dynamics are rarely disturbed by fading to freekicks or throw-ins, the game continues to run while the players are getting the ball ready, which is very good. When there are cut scenes they are well used and hardly interfere. It feels more like watching a game on TV.
The game dynamics have also improved a lot, offensive players move smartly and the defense also makes few mistakes. In order to get a goal situation you have to either trick the opponent to open up passing situations or outplay the opponent with well-directed passes. At the moment, besides the friendly matches and online games, there is only the Dream Team mode, where you create and manage a team online and play against the AI or online games. It is good that you can buy the standard players directly and do not have to pull from ""packs"". These then start at level 0 and you have to level them up to their normal value and then you can go a bit beyond that. Very good I found here the possibility that you can choose the value upgrades yourself and thus can form your perfect player. You can e.g. skill MBappe to be more focused on speed and dribbling to let him play more on the wing or increase the values for finishing and attacking to set him up as a center forward. The choice is up to you. Since Efootball is free, there is a fear that the game will become pay-to-win. So far, however, I have been able to do well with my non-pay-to-win team and have not had the feeling that I had a big disadvantage compared to the other players. The good thing is that Featured players and the ""normal form"" of the same players usually have the same values when they are at the highest level. Featured players just start at a higher value and don't need to level up as long. Also, Featured players often have an alternate focus on skills. Only some legend players that are hard to get are a lot better than the ""normal"" counterparts. I would have been happy if legendaries had been just as good and you only acquired them, for example, if you were a big fan, so as not to break the balance of the game. But so far opponents had only 2-3 legends in the team and the difference was not so big that you have no chance against them.

All in all, I think the game is good, it's fun and brings a lot of new features. But some corners must still be tweaked.",True,english

It's good advice for Project Zomboid as well: reject shouting and boomsticks, embrace pointy sticks and long blunt sticks.

Still, between becoming a survival sim or John Rambo every zombie with a s&%t storm of bullets, the game is so very much worth the buy.

With a heavy focus on realism and player choice, this survival sandbox offers a deeply immersive experience that few other games can match. Whether you’re managing your character’s health, building your dream base, or evading hordes of undead, Project Zomboid keeps you on your toes at every moment. Having spent over 730 hours in the game, I can confidently say that it delivers one of the best survival experiences available today.

1. Realism Done Right
Despite the fictional backdrop of a zombie apocalypse, Project Zomboid nails realism in almost every aspect of gameplay. The most valuable tip for any new player is simply: ""What would you do in this situation?"" The game's health system is intricate, with injuries, illnesses, and mental states all playing a role. Clothes protect you from zombie bites, degrade over time, and help regulate body temperature, which is vital. Mechanics like repairing vehicles, dealing with character traits and professions, and managing inventory weight make everything feel real. I especially love how character emotions and moods affect gameplay – it’s small touches like these that elevate Project Zomboid to another level of immersion.

2. An Open World That Never Ends
The current game world is massive, and despite having played over 730 hours, I still didn't explore all the areas. I admire the sheer size of the map, and with upcoming updates promising to expand it further and even include randomly generated maps in the distant future. Project Zomboid also offers infinite gameplay and replayability. It’s one of those survival games you can play over and over without ever getting tired.

3. Sandbox Customization Options
One of my favorite aspects is the ability to tailor the world to your liking. From the number and behavior of zombies to loot distribution, characters (players), and more, Project Zomboid lets you tweak almost anything. It gives you the power to create a world that fits your personal playstyle or challenge yourself with tougher scenarios.

4. Character Creation and Professions
This is hands-down one of my favorite features in the game. Choosing different professions and character traits, both positive and negative, significantly changes how the game plays. I also appreciate the subtle bonuses and drawbacks that aren’t immediately obvious – it adds an extra layer of depth. The balance in this system is present, too, so don’t expect to create an overpowered character unless you tweak the sandbox settings to do so!

5. Community Mods
While Project Zomboid doesn’t need mods to be great, the fact that they’re available is a huge bonus. The modding community has added incredible content, from enhanced realism to new vehicles, traits, weapons, and crafting options. There’s too much to describe in one review! That said, I recommend playing without mods at first to truly grasp the game’s mechanics, but later on, mods can make the experience even better.

6. Skill Levels and Physical Attributes
Project Zomboid features an extensive skill system that allows players to improve their characters through practice and experience. Skills are divided into categories like combat, crafting, survival, and agility, each having a noticeable impact on gameplay. Combat skills such as aiming and reloading become crucial for firearm users, while melee skills like blunt and blade proficiency determine how effective you are with weapons like baseball bats or axes. Crafting skills, including carpentry, metalworking, and tailoring, let you fortify your base, repair clothes, or even create tools from scratch.
Survival skills like foraging and fishing allow you to live off the land when resources run dry, and farming lets you grow your own food, providing a sustainable source of nutrition. Agility skills, such as sneaking and lightfooted, are essential for staying hidden from zombies, while sprinting helps you escape when the situation gets dire.
Physical attributes like strength and fitness are equally important, as they directly affect how much weight you can carry, how fast you tire, and how effective you are in combat. Improving your strength means you can carry heavier loads and hit harder with melee attacks, while better fitness ensures you can run longer distances and recover faster from exhaustion. Each skill progresses the more you use it, making every action in the game feel meaningful and rewarding.

7. Intriguing (But Optional) Lore
While the storyline isn’t central to the player’s experience yet, it does exist, and it’s fascinating. I only started diving into the game’s lore after playing for about 500 hours, and once I did, I was hooked. I went so far as to read up on the game’s backstory online (beware of spoilers!) Exploring the lore adds a new dimension to the game. I highly recommend getting to know the lore yourself!

8. A Sandbox Experience
Want to build? Build. Want to destroy? Go ahead. In Project Zomboid, your creativity (and characters human possibilities) are your only limits. The only challenge is gathering materials, which makes sense given the post-apocalyptic setting. But with enough time and motivation, you can accomplish incredible things. This open-ended approach is perfect for players who enjoy creating and building their own worlds.

9. Active Developer Support
The game is still in early access, and while it may not be updated on a daily basis, the developers deliver large, meaningful updates. They listen to player feedback, fix bugs, and continue to improve the game without ignoring the community, which is something I greatly respect.

10. Hidden Depths
Just when you think you’ve learned everything there is to know about Project Zomboid, it surprises you. The game is full of hidden mechanics and features that add to the depth of the experience. I’ve had several moments where I thought I had mastered the game, only to discover a new layer of complexity. It’s a game that keeps on giving.

11. Fair Price
Finally, let’s talk about the price. For what Project Zomboid offers, the price is perfect. But if you’re looking to save a bit of money, it’s always worth waiting for a sale. Either way, you’re getting your money’s worth for this gem of a game.

Project Zomboid is a truly exceptional survival game that combines deep realism with sandbox freedom. Whether you're fighting off zombies, building your own fortress, or scavenging for supplies, every moment feels impactful. With continuous updates, an active modding community, and endless replayability, it’s a game that will keep you coming back for more. I can’t recommend it highly enough to fans of survival games or anyone looking for a challenging, immersive experience.",True,english

This game is hard, like vary hard, if you are new you will die a lot to older players.  So here are a few things you can do to get better at the game.

1. Don't cheat.  You will not get better if you do cheat and you will make the game worse by doing so.
2. Listen to your surroundings.  This can make you win or loss a game just because you could not hear where the other players shots are coming from so you put your back towards the player shooting at you instead of facing them.
3. Do not land at popular sites, this is an easy and fast way to go back to the lobby, instead look for locations at least 1km from where the plane is flying and go there.
4. Play with friends and use VOIP.  You can use the in game VOIP, but what I use is Discord.
5. Don't go more then 100 m from your team mates.  This way when one of you is in trouble, 3 of your team mates are at positions to aid you.  Also don't be to close to each other, as this makes you easier to spot and makes it harder for you and your team mates to return fire when you are in a fire fight.
6. When you see someone, ping them so your team mates know where they are and can aid it taking them down.
7. Take a automatic weapon and a long range weapon (DMR or SR).  My suggestion for a new player is a SMG and a DMR.  For SMG use one of the 3, UMP, VECTOR, MP5K.  As for DMR's, use SLR or DRAGUNOV.
8. Carry at least 4 First Aid kits, 10 bandages, and 4 boosts.
9. Carry 2-3 Smoke grenades.
10. Just have fun.

The game immerses you in a way that few can, combining its gripping story, breathtaking visuals, and impeccable soundtrack to pull you into the dystopian Night City. There were countless times where I would just stop to look around and take in the gorgeous views.

I found the blend of FPS and RPG elements to be very fun and engaging. Building up V's strength throughout the game was particularly satisfying for me, particularly in how it can interplay with the narrative, even if on the smaller side. Difficulty wise I thought it was pretty balanced overall. It does get on the easier side of things from mid to late game but I don't mind that at all. The game is limited to first person, which I didn't mind after awhile. It's an FPS after all. 
Overall, I loved the high octane, high stakes approach it takes to its combat.

I did not play this game when it first launched, so I have no idea what issues from release still remain. I can however report on the problems I did find regularly:
- Poor LOD Rendering
There were many times, particularly after installing the Phantom Liberty DLC, where the game's engine struggled a lot with loading LODs properly. I mainly noticed it with the NPCs and vehicles, especially when driving, where they would load at very low detail until you're like a few steps away. Rarely when driving, the road can just unload for some reason and become invisible for a couple seconds, which can really screw with you. This is pretty uncommon though.
- Low Traffic Density While Driving
When you're not driving around the city, the traffic is pretty normal. However, once you start going at high speeds on the road, traffic seems to diminish significantly. This does create an uncanny result considering its supposed to be a mega city. It seems the game does this to further save on resources, but it is still somewhat distracting how little traffic there can be.
- Vehicle Summoning
The game allows you to call your vehicle, and it will drive itself to you. Even to this day, the menu for this still says the feature is in beta. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any plans to properly finish it. Now, I bring this up because a lot of the time, the place that it chooses to spawn your car is..not great. Sometimes it will spawn on another road that's like a block away, and other times it spawns it in other vehicles. But on occasion, the car may straight up spawn in the air, where you can watch it gracefully tumble all the way to the ground. Other than traditional fast travel, cars and motorcycles are the de facto way to get around Night City, so a feature like this should probably have had more time in the oven.

Despite those recurring issues I had, they are nowhere near game breaking. They only hurt the already amazing immersion a bit. I did not really experience any crashes before installing mods, so those issues seem to be gone. In all, I definitely think the game is in a good place now. If you were thinking about getting Cyberpunk for yourself, I highly recommend it.",True,english

All the RPG elements you'd expect, fully voiced, great post-release maintenance/commitment and in a truly interesting non-fanstasy setting. The mechanics don't really mirror Cyberpunk 2020 or Cyberpunk: RED TTRPGs; while unfortunate, the mechanics in this game are solid.

And best of all, the game very moddable with a vibrant, engaged, and productive mod community.

Only disappointing aspect was that it has no 3rd person. You cannot see the character of the story, you cannot see their cool moves and action. Rather it's like you, the player at the computer, is there rather than the character of the story. And it wasn't immediately apparent how this weakens the whole experience.

But other than that there are only two minor points of weakness, both addressable in the mature product:
1. Boss fights assume certain style of play--the dev's preference. This is solvable by mods.
2. CDPR having their favorite story ending and putting weak effort into other endings because you should have thought like the devs and writers to get the best endgame experience [see Witcher 3]. This is solvable by research and then playing the fleshed out single ending CDPR envisioned.

Everything else is top notch, engaging, and fun. Has all the RPG elements you'd expect and good quests, decent story lines. DLC is lacking, but they did release one at least--it's also very decent; almost more interesting than the main storyline [again, see Witcher 3].

The World of Cyberpunk 2077 is a dark and gritty one. A dystopian but but also real future where you're either rich or barely surviving. but what makes this game beautiful is, despite it all, you keep fighting for a better life, never fully loosing hope even at your lowest of lows. the game shows this with not only your character but also the supporting cast. Characters who often seem hard and tuff like the city has forced them to be opening up to you and being vurnurable to you as you get to know them. Judy, Panam, heck even Johnny Silverhand. all characters who I will remember and cherish.

Now as to the gameplay when this game first came out it was, and I pardon my language, Dogshit... But ever since the 2.0 update they overhauled everything and somehow did a complete 180! With the gunplay going from feeling unimpactful and bland to OOMPHY in the best way possible and then the upgrade system acually feeling worth it with new abilities and customization to make truly unique and fun builds all of which are viable! I personaly love fully upgrading reflexes allowing me to dash and dodge around both on ground and mid-air for some really fun almost bullethell like movement or going for a more stealth build allowing you to quickly take out enemy bases and finish gigs with a quick swipe reall assassin style! just a few of the many ways to play the game and I can practically garantee that there is a playstyle for you! So much fun.

The music is also amazing and somethign I wanna highlight as a producer myself. It really perfected what Cyberpunk should sound like. It's drone like nature with these elements of punk music really fusing together in such a unique way! It just has this tensity to it that just feels suspenseful. Then there's the action music which I swear I would be so much stealthier if it didn't go as hard as it goes cuz DAMN it makes me pumped! It's so intense and adrenaline filled and fits so well to every senario! truly spectacular.
but the best tracks in the game for me are the more quiet ones. the ones that play in somber or joyful moments. the themes of the characters you meet. Johnnys theme using a cello/violin making it sound like a guitar somehow is just beautiful and really shows another side of johnny in a way. and leidmotives of ""never fade away"" (a song by Johnnys band) playing at just the right times making it almost a theme of sorts for the events that it plays in. I dunno It just adds so much to the imersion and I can't get enough of it.

And don't even get me started on the DLC. Phantom Liberty is one of the best expansions I have ever played. The district of Dogtown is dense and full of fun activities to do, but once again the highlights are the characters. Somehow they're even deeper than before, feeling like acual people who all have unique motives and personalities that when it came time to choose I couldn't decide cuz I cared so much for all of them. I wanted the best for all of them but due to the nature of the story (which i won't spoil) I could'nt and it was heartbreaking, but it also felt beautiful in a way. Just absolutly phenomenal story telling and a story I will never forget.

In the end I would personally highly recommend this game. It's a game I always come back to replay, a world that I can't get enough of and one of those games that gave me something I'll keep for the rest of my life. It might take some time to get into but trust me once ur in it will be an experience you will never forget. an experience that, despite it's dark nature, made me feel hope. A thing of beauty for sure.

and a thing of beauty will never fade away...
Keep fighting",True,english

The main story is staged in Night City, an open-world sandbox with a mix of neo-noir and ganster movie characters and narratives. While the DLC's is significantly smaller in scope, it's a tight, well written spy thriller that keeps some of the same beats (the heist elements) but remains fresh with new stakes and an interesting cast.
The RPG is well implemented: in addition to ""cyberware"" -interchangeable parts that influence your controls, movements patterns, weapon affinity and some gameplay interactions, you have 3 main variables that make for very deep character building: Attributes, Perks and Skills.
You have 5 main Attributes- each Attributes will have its own ""Perk"" tree. Raising an Attribute (up to a max of 20) will unlock more (and better) Perks. Attributes mostly have an influence on weapon proficiency and some interactions, but will also impact how you approach certain missions. Will you break the door? Can you hack the door? Can you stay hidden or will you ram through? The 3D environment of Night City helps you tackle situations with a wide variety of possible solutions.
While the ""Attributes"" can only be reset once per game, the Perks can be refunded and distributed again as many times as you wish outside combat, encouraging experimentation. You can see which weapons work best for you, how your perks interact with each other and your cybernetic implants.
The Skills progress naturally- anytime you perform an action, take down an enemy with a certain weapon, pass a dialogue or Attribute check- the related Skill will increase. Up to a max of 50, every 5 levels you will unlock a permanent boost.

I think the main downside to the game is how long it is- not all missions are created equal and sometimes it's a drag or a bit of a bore, but those moments are few and sandwiched between thrilling combat sequence. Didn't particularly care for the DB elements either.

Overall 9/10, the few narrative lapses or repetitive nature of some missions didn't spoil my fun enough to bring the score lower than that. I would just add that the soundtrack is a constant banger and is very serviceable to the story.",True,english

After finally folding and purchasing the base game at a discount, I quickly grew to love the combat system, methods of gaining power, and especially the story the game told. The most important part of any game to me is the story, followed by the combat mechanics, then the graphics. Cyberpunk smashed all my expectations so much so that I purchased Phantom Liberty at full price when I was halfway through the game, solely because I knew I wanted more content before the end of the game. I'm very glad I did. The DLC has been wonderful, and without spoiling it, I would rate it 2 tiers above the base game (7/10 - base, 9/10 DlC, for an average of 8/10). Note that 5/10 simply means ""average"" and reasonable for the experience/price. I fully recommend the DLC if you enjoyed the base game.",True,english

1. For some reason, when the chase starts and you get hit by a car and continue driving, we did not continue. Our car got pushed to the gate and didn't move. I had to restart.
2. Then when you start fighting scavs, it's needlessly hard. It's my 2nd playthrough, on hard difficulty. On hard, I killed Adam Smasher on 2nd try at just lvl 35 with sucky cyberware, and I'd say Adam Smasher is one of the hardest bosses in the game. This thing took me 5 tries. My advice -- when you get out of car, you get blades. Forget the blades, get back to pistol, find cover and be very careful as they'll shred you very quickly. Be careful with skulls and netrunners. First time I got killed by a runner.
3. After finally doing this, I go to the ""wounded scav"" and... nothing happens. It's bugged again. Trust me, I tried everything and I don't think I did anything unusual to cause it. 

At this point I just lost it. Come on, The DLC had been out for a year now, and the base game is 4 years old at this point. I understand that making games of this scale is hard.

I haven't experienced that kind of make you sit back and reflect on the things that you did to get you where you had to go since Geralt found Ciri in The Witcher 3.

The dlc is its own thing pretty much with an extra ending of its own, which has the added benefit of skipping the remainder of the core vidya.

Now, onto the good things: the script, the pacing, the dialogues, the execution of a properly polished thriller. The DLC adds some extra missions for old fixers. Fetch quests aside, the quest are good too, adding depth and nuance to the NPCs. Though the most important is the selection of end-game choices you're presented with. Between wetwork, dubious loyalties and complex motivations of dramatis personaes, someone did their homework on intelligence services so a lot of it offers a very authentic experience. A lot of times you leave feeling dirty - because that is the nature of the work. My only criticism is you couldn't off Meyers (it'd be tons of fun, I think), but otherwise it's next to excellent. Johnny's dialogue at the end of the lunar escape was a rare gem, diverging from his usual abrasive rants. Meeting Mr Hands in person was somewhat of a letdown, but more gigs from the sphinxian villain was welcome.

It's difficult to believe the DLC was produced by the same studio as the cliché and filth-filled dumpster fire that is the core game. The setting remains as disgusting as ever, with humanity locked in a dull and primitive state of neo-feudal corporate overlords or communes of plain-roaming barbarians, but Phantom Liberty redeems the price tag. If you find a way to skip to the DLC and just play the extra, do it: it is a real treat for any lovers of a spy drama - something Deux Ex tried and failed to do.

Edit: ending credits animation film was an outstanding tribute to the classic James Bond movies. Stellar.",True,english

Imagine if James Bond, Keanu Reeves, and Idris Elba decided to throw a party in Night City, and you get to clean up the mess. That’s Phantom Liberty for you.

The expansion kicks off with the President of the New United States crash-landing in Dogtown. Yes, you read that right. Apparently, Air Force One now comes with a “crash here for plot development” button. You’re hired to rescue her, but not before you navigate through a maze of cybernetic baddies, morally ambiguous choices, and enough plot twists to make a pretzel jealous.

Idris Elba’s character, Solomon Reed, is the secret agent we all wish we could be. He’s suave, he’s mysterious, and he probably has a better skincare routine than you. Meanwhile, Keanu Reeves returns as Johnny Silverhand, still rocking that “I hate the system” vibe but with a touch more existential dread. It’s like watching your cool uncle go through a mid-life crisis, but with more explosions.

Dogtown itself is a marvel. It’s like someone took all the worst parts of a dystopian future and decided to make it a tourist attraction. The local wildlife includes cyber-enhanced gangsters and vending machines that might just try to sell you a grenade. But hey, at least the street food is to die for—literally.

The gameplay is a rollercoaster of emotions. One moment you’re making life-or-death decisions, the next you’re wondering why your character’s pants have suddenly disappeared. It’s all part of the Cyberpunk experience, folks. Embrace the chaos.

In conclusion, Phantom Liberty is the perfect blend of high-stakes drama, cybernetic mayhem, and unintentional comedy. It’s like a soap opera set in a dystopian future, and honestly, we wouldn’t have it any other way. So, grab your cyberdeck, put on your best trench coat, and dive into the madness. Just watch out for those vending machines.",True,english

A Personal Journey into Peaceful Creativity:

From the moment I launched Tiny Glade, I felt as though I'd stepped into a serene oasis far removed from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Developed by the indie studio Pounce Light, this game isn't just about building structures—it's about building moments of peace and allowing your imagination to wander freely.


Visual Poetry in Motion:

The game's visuals are nothing short of enchanting. The hand-crafted art style feels warm and inviting, like flipping through the pages of a beautifully illustrated storybook. Each element, from the gently swaying trees to the softly glowing windows of a cottage, is rendered with such care that it’s impossible not to feel a sense of wonder. I often found myself pausing just to watch the way the sunlight filtered through the leaves or how the shadows danced across the rolling hills.


Embracing the Freedom to Create:

What sets Tiny Glade apart is its emphasis on unstructured creativity. There are no timers ticking down or resources to hoard—just an open canvas waiting for your touch. The grid-free building system felt incredibly liberating. I could effortlessly draw a winding stone wall that morphed seamlessly into a quaint archway or let a cobblestone path meander through a meadow without constraints.

At one point, I started constructing a small village nestled at the edge of a forest. As I added little details—a lantern here, a flowerbed there—the place began to feel alive. It was as if the game was encouraging me to tell my own story without uttering a single word.


An Auditory Hug:

The sound design is like a gentle hug for your ears. The soft rustle of leaves, distant bird songs, and the occasional whisper of the wind combined to create a soundscape that was both relaxing and rejuvenating. The music is subtle, never overpowering the experience, but always enhancing the mood.

Reflections on User Experience:

Navigating through Tiny Glade is a breeze. The intuitive controls allowed me to focus on creating rather than fumbling with mechanics. There was a moment when I accidentally erased a section of my build, and instead of feeling frustrated, I found that the game's forgiving nature turned it into an opportunity to try something new. It's rare to find a game that so seamlessly blends user-friendliness with depth.


The Joy of Unwinding:

In a world where games often demand so much from us—be it quick reflexes, strategic thinking, or constant vigilance—Tiny Glade is a welcome reprieve. It's a space where you can slow down, take a deep breath, and let your mind wander.


Final Thoughts:

Tiny Glade isn't just a game; it's an experience—a gentle reminder of the joy found in simplicity and creativity. It rekindles that childlike wonder we often lose along the way. Whether you're an avid gamer looking for something different or someone who simply wants a peaceful escape, Tiny Glade offers a sanctuary worth visiting.",True,english

The game is beautiful but not as innocent as it looks. The real fun is in giving yourself a task and then solving it. Sometimes it takes less than a minute and sometimes quite a few minutes. Tools seem rudimentary but you can do a lot with them if you know what you are doing. At the beginning you don't.

Some remarks:
- edge scrolling needed ASAP. All the city builders have it and I am trying to use it all the time. WASD is clumsy.
- save system is not intuitive at all. 
- smoke looks like a paper towel floating above the chimney. If you have several houses with chimneys it seems that they are having a toilet paper feast.

- bigger terrain
- sheep and ducks are nice but I do miss people; they would not have to do anything, just move around.

[i]I am a seasoned gamer, I played from A to Z, hundreds and even more hundreds of games since the '90, I know my games and am proud of it. I saw this game, a few days ago, thought it looked nice, relaxing; I saw it had a demo and that its full release wasn't far away. I got immediately hooked, Elden Ring style, but without the frustration and concentration factor, replaced with utter calmness, peace of mind.[/i]

[b]Review(?):[/b]
The game itself is as easy as formidable, it delivers in what it wants you to do and what you actually want to do.
I'm no architect, but I managed to create little scenarios that made me chuckle as I was astonished by how beautiful and cute everything looked; every time I am done and happy with the results of that session, I take screenshots.
You could include ""Background Creator"" in the game's tags, because they are so gorgeous and ""soft"" that it calms you just by looking at a picture of something you created, out of literally nothing.

-Having the possibility to play a demo is a major up: every game should give you this opportunity before buying.

-The price is.. great, I was afraid to find 30-40-50 euros at its release, but they stayed true to what the game is; it's easy to find games that cost double and triple of this one and aren't this memorable nowadays, so thank you for that.

-No crash has ever happened, not in the full release nor the demo. I locked it at 60fps, render scale at 1.1 having my pc's performance set quite low so to not make it work, practically at all. Increasing the render scale increases the impact on your pc by a lot, can't say why as I have quite good specs. Upping the render scale to ""just"" 2.0 squashes my fps to around 20, but I'm using my pc in, almost, sleep mode. If you have problems with performance, lower the render scale by 0.1 until you're happy, it will still look good.

-I've read some reviews that say how this game is lacking in content, that they played a couple dozen minutes and ""finished it"", to that I can just say that they aren't made for this kind of games and that would be ok if they would say so. Not recommending a game that isn't in your alley, and not specifying it, is in my opinion, wrong. You could play hundreds of hours and not get tired (please not consecutively); the content is in your head. I just put a window on corner of a tower-like square building, then I put a second, and a third, at the end I had a section of the tower converted into a 360° window, it all worked so good and naturally that I stopped and thought what a great job the devs made, because they did.

-Sometimes it's ""hard"" to start without nothing, but if you continue you'll be amazed by the results; the glades start with something already pre-built, to give you an idea and the daily ""challenge"" is great for a quick session where you continue something, I presume, they created for the occasion.

[b]Verdict:[/b]
A cute and relaxing building/city builder that gives you the reins to your imagination (in this context of course).
Enough content for as long as your imagination is fresh and trained, or you're willing to let go for a while and just click away; there's a start, but no end.
I am sure they'll add even more nice content, decorations, not for us to place individually, but seamlessly attack to what is around it (tables and chair on a flat roof for example), maybe more wall designs; I'm very confident they'll continue to work on it, and deliver.

It's a [b]9/10[/b] for me, it is just that beautiful and meets its promises like no other game lately.

From the moment you shrink down to the size of an ant and step into the backyard, you’re immersed in a beautifully crafted environment that feels both familiar and fantastical. Every blade of grass towers like a tree, every droplet of water shimmers with detail, and every tiny pebble feels like a boulder—Grounded transforms the mundane into something magical.

The art style is where this game truly shines. The bright, vibrant colors bring the backyard to life, giving it a playful and inviting feel. Despite the dangers that lurk in the grass, there's an undeniable warmth to the world that makes exploration feel rewarding. It captures the essence of being a kid again—where everything feels larger than life, full of wonder and possibility. The way the sunlight filters through leaves, the texture of a dandelion puff, and the glistening of dew drops all add to the sense that you’re in a living, breathing micro-ecosystem.

The attention to detail is remarkable. Each insect is brought to life with such care, from the twitching antennae of ants to the translucent wings of ladybugs. These creatures move and behave in a way that makes the world feel alive, and interacting with them is both thrilling and enchanting. There’s something incredibly charming about watching a line of ants march off with crumbs of food or hearing the distant chirping of crickets as night falls.

Even in moments of danger, when a wolf spider comes charging out of the undergrowth or a bombardier beetle sprays its acid, the art style retains a sense of wonder. It’s a perfect blend of cute and creepy, striking a balance that keeps you invested without losing the game's whimsical tone.

The overall aesthetic of Grounded makes it feel like a love letter to adventure and curiosity, capturing that childhood sense of exploration where every corner of the yard feels like a brand-new world to discover. It’s a game that invites you to slow down, look around, and appreciate the beauty in the little things.

If you're looking for a survival game that offers more than just crafting and combat, Grounded stands out with its charming art style and world design. It’s a delightful experience that turns a simple backyard into a vibrant, awe-inspiring adventure playground. Whether you’re playing solo or with friends, you’ll find yourself constantly amazed at how enchanting the tiniest details can be.",True,english

QOL is decidedly lacking as well, a prime example of which is the level restricted access to blueprinting. Another good example of poor QOL is that everytime you open a number of menus (you will do this a lot) it plays a smoke-detectoresque beep/chirp the volume of which is controlled by main volume.

I want to preface this review by saying [b]this is not a game to turn your brain off to.[/b] You will think and puzzle over how you want to accomplish the goals set before you.

[h1]An amazing escape[/h1]
That being said: [b]Satisfactory is not stressful in the slightest,[/b] If you do start to feel overwhelmed by the factory, you can explore a absolutely massive map and collect materials to unwind.

[h1]Easy to learn, hard to master[/h1]
The game is super easy to get into and understand, but if you aren't careful, larger builds can become messy and hard to work with. [b]Don't get discouraged[/b] if you can't make beautiful, efficient factories right off the bat. I'm 257 hours in and just now starting to get the hang of organizing my factories.

TL:DR
- Satisfactory is an amazing game for people who enjoy thinking and creating. Programmers, math nerds, engineers, and builders will all find themselves at home. 
- There is a high skill ceiling, but the game is easy to start and enjoyable to learn.
- The map is beautiful and huge so there is plenty of room to explore when you aren't building your factories.",True,english

HOWEVER, the biggest concern is the servers they have. Right now there's only realistically 4-5 servers running and I hear EU servers arent always up and if you're like me who lives in Australia which needs a Oceania server which doesnt exist then you're looking about 250 ping to play which lags liike crazy on Asia & US server.
Will change to a thumbs up once they've added new servers in hopefully this game continues to grow as I have high hopes for it!

UPDATE: Pretty disappointed at how the management is with this game as they try to do a lot of banning and not to mention banning stream snipers instead of focusing more time on actually trying to open new servers up so to get more exposure for the game.....Right now it's kind of a turn off so decided to uninstall it.

UPDATE 2: The good news is that other servers are up but unfortunately it's leaving players wants to support that are in the Oceania region super dead clearly the devs should be more transparent about this so now they just seem to avoid the question all together........",False,english

amazing.
a few bad bosses, nothing a avg person cant manage.
needs to work on the progression of the game, I feel like I cant wear a armor set that's actually cool because you unlock a new craft every 1-2 hours and most of the time they are way better than what ever armor set you crafted before that. 
the combat is great and I feel like there is a lot of build variety especially when you get some of the mythical staffs. 
the game is long and great. ~50 hours for me to beat 6 chapters, and get the true ending so :)...

probably going to buy the dlc when ever it comes out, which is very soon actually because the base game was supposed to have like 11 chapters and most of the chapters had most of the design done",True,english

Everyone complained that something new was needed.

So then for years, game developers tried everything they could think of to change the gaming paradigm into not just something different than the classic game modes, but how to monetize the crap out of it while pushing their own political narrative and morals. Everyone complained about how this sucked, and we missed the good old days of campaign, multi player PvE, and PvP. No monetizing the crap out of us, and no political agendas to be found.

Space Marine 2 is a fantastic return to the ""good old days."" No agendas, just game lore followed. Hack and slash with a smattering of strategy. Classic game modes and game play.

My very low end computer has some trouble running the game, nonetheless I will not say that adds any negative remarks on the game; I made a poor investment for gaming. Luckily I have friends who let me play on their consoles and experience the game.

The Story is not over bearing with characters speech that adds nothing to the game. A casual gamer looking for a couch co-op game can jump into the story and understand the general idea of what is happening and enjoy the story. Furthermore, someone who is decently well versed in the grim dark universe will appreciate characters building upon the setting and making the player feel as if they are apart of a multi planet defense against heretical xenos.

The game play is not exactly casual, offering a challenge to players that can be overcome with most any game play style chosen. The game brings back a hack and slash, co-op gamer missed by many of gamers. The combat is executed in a cinematic world built with care to detail, with brutal combat and satisfying finishers.

Although unlike Dark Souls parrying is basically required just like Sekiro except the timing is a bit harder. Although I am a Souls veteran, I struggled immensely on the first somewhat challenging boss because it was pretty much a test of how well you could parry as simply whiff punishing between his attacks did very little damage. So parrying was the only way to get big damage by breaking his posture and riposting him. Once you master that, you've ""gotten good"" at LoP. There is also the rally system from Bloodborne, which just lets you regain most of the damage taken from blocking if you attack the opponent a few times after.

The first part of this review is for the general game, the second part is the threshold where I accepted it wasn't worth continuing.

Pros:
1.  The Legion arm mechanic is pretty cool.  Essentially preset secondary equipments that can be upgraded to add new passives to them.  Examples include a staggering grapple hook, a charge up electric blast, a landmine summoner, and a a retaliatory shield.  Legion arms allow you to get a boost against harder foes that your weapon proves insufficient for.
2.  Parry mechanics.  Depending on what kind of enemy your fighting, a perfect parry will either help stagger them for a combo hit or help shatter their weapon, reducing attack variety and damage.
3.  Specters act as boss assists if you're frustrated or unable to defeat a boss.  It's a pretty big help if your too frustrated.

Cons:
1.  Underwhelming soundtrack.  The only music in the game outside of the gramophone is against bosses, and they all sound pretty similar.
2.  Finite resources.  There's only one copy of each weapon, armor, and amulet, with no way to get more.  If you sold or missed an item, it's gone forever, the entire playthrough.  Quartz, the skilltree material, can't even cover half the skilltree without running out for the rest of the playthrough.  Cranks, allowing you to tinker with weapon scaling, are also finite, discouraging experimentation.  Consumables have to be slowly grinded for until chapter 5 when you can buy them.
3.  Rushed choices.  Any time the game has you make a narrative choice, it gives you about 6 seconds before automatically selecting whatever your cursor touched last, leaving no time to think anything through.  This leads to decisions feeling incoherent and shallow.
4.  Lack of information.  The game doesn't tell you what three of your six stats even do, making the early game confusing.  Status effects only tell you what they do once they've killed you.

Last part of my review is unfairness.  Up until Elysian Boulevard, the game does quite well with dying being your fault rather than cheap shots or instant death.  Once you reach the boss there, you have your first instance of simply full on stun locking you with no escape method.  Once you trudge your way through that, you soon hit the swamp monster, with the ability to also kill you in one inescapable combo, but with the addition of being far too durable to kill with consumables and shredding your specter.  Outside of bosses, several things lead to being unfair.  Several points have enemy locations that you can't reasonably deal with, leading to barely avoidable damage.

Keep in mind that this is my first souls like, so I can't compare it well to others.  I do enjoy difficult games such as Dead Cells and Celeste, but difficult and unfair are rather different things.",False,english

This game compared to most Souls-like games has given the most care out of any games I have seen. Not many games give an equal fairness into their mechanics besides this one.

The story, the combat, the variety of combat weapons, and the goddamn level design and setting of the game just comes out as one of my Top 10 games of all time.

I own Elden Ring, but I never completed it because I got too lost in its open-world concept. However, this game was an amazing introduction to the genre, especially considering it comes from a smaller studio, not a massive corporation.

The story is captivating, and the game does a great job guiding you through it. The voice acting is absolutely incredible—most games have at least a bit of cringe in their dialogue, but not this one. The performances are top-notch.

Combat is really fun and rewarding. Parrying can break enemies' weapons, and you can combine different weapons and handles (I mostly used boss weapons throughout the game). I didn’t find the game overly difficult either—you can even beat some bosses with throwable items, and certain bosses allow you to summon an aid, which is super helpful.

The music is also insane. It’s one of the highlights of the game for sure. After beating it, I immediately wanted to start another playthrough, but I’ve heard that DLC and a sequel have been announced, so I’m waiting for that. When the DLC drops, I’m definitely doing another run with a new weapon setup.

If you’ve never played a Souls game, I really believe this is a great entry point into the genre. I highly recommend it!",True,english

Great story. Mostly great game. 3 of the bosses try hard to ruin it.

Given the fact that this is a game built almost entirely on parrying, it's frustrating when you can't stop a chain of actions to parry or dodge. Also any hit seems to slightly stagger P. For a split second you can't move and for just slightly longer you can't parry or dodge. Not a problem for most of the game, but for the very fast bosses chaining attacks, it's annoying you can see P not reacting to your input as another attack comes in. Yet for the most part, your attacks don't have the same effect.

There are minor issues with it such as bosses that jump very high in the air, yet the camera angle cannot look straight up. In some places it's like ledges are covered in grease. It's possible to be pinned against a wall or object by an enemy and have no way out, it's effectively a death sentence with certain enemies.

*Minor spoilers*
Most of the bosses are fun with good cut scenes.
3 of them are not fun. The King of Puppets, Laxasia and the Nameless puppet.
There is clearly a reason the achievement % drops off at each of these.
The times I beat them, it was luck of the draw of how aggressive the boss was feeling that round.

Sometimes it feels like that game goes out of it's way to kill you if you do ""too well"" and get close to killing the boss quickly in the first few rounds. You'll soon be punished with an onslaught. Yet if you just stand there and practice parrying, you don't get the same intense beating.

For the fights with the spectre, for me just using a single HP re-gen wish on it worked well to keep the boss distracted for longer. Other wishes are okay, but nowhere near as impactful as simply having two of you in the battle for longer.

Save throwing items until you have the boss down to <10% health, then use them to help finish it quick. Otherwise don't bother using them, they're effectively a limited resource before you'll have to go out farming for them. 

I beat each of the above 3 by using fable arts and throwables in those last few moments.",True,english

Lies of P sees you lead as Gepetto's puppet in a twisted, gloomy take on the folktale of Pinocchio. Waking up in an eerie train station, you soon make your way outside to the city of Krat, where a sudden trigger in the puppets causes a haunting massacre that sets the tone for the rest of the game.

     On that note, atmosphere is the name. Hotel Krat is your central hub, and it quickly evolved from being a brief trip to level up my weapons into a safe retreat where I could listen to a vibrant soundtrack in the background as I spoke with the many charismatic faces that made up this iconic location. It's not just the hub area - everything from oil-lined streets to infested cathedrals, the immense amount of detail present within the level design itself across most of the chapters is incredibly impressive. Whether it was my first playthrough or my sixth, I could not help but immerse myself in all of the intricately placed bodies & texts around the city that truly cements this game as an all-time example of how to do proper environmental storytelling within linear experiences. Neowiz and Round8 really wear the inspiration on their sleeves with the worldbuilding here and it's very well executed. (Note: it runs flawlessly for me on an upper-end rig, but even on my steam deck it is the best performing game I own. It's also very nicely balanced and well-paced. I would say I preferred the difficulty around launch, as it really heightened my enjoyment of this game in a unique way because of how challenging it was. But it's still a decent challenge and NG+ definitely brought that difficulty back.) 

     Combat is really where Lies of P hits all of its strides for me. As a fan of FromSoftware's 'soulsborne' entries for the better part of a decade, I believe Lies of P implements so many positive spins on their formula that I would recommend this over the traditional souls games to any player, regardless of experience (well... maybe play Sekiro.) For example, one of my favorite mechanics is pulse recharge, which allows you to gain one more charge to your healing consumable if you are at zero. This feature would change the entire dynamic of so many of my fights in an instant. Maybe I'm playing defensively, I've got two more heals and 60% of the boss's health left; in scenarios like this, every single time I reached zero heals, my brain would switch to aggression immediately in the hopes of regaining a charge and feel more 'comfortable.' I cannot speak to everyone's experience, but this mechanic made me a better player over time as I was PUSHED into being more active in my gameplay and subsequently rewarded with the most satisfying sound effect I've heard since the Halo CE shield recharge as a single pulse cell materializes right back into your upper belt. 

     Another great feature to the combat sandbox is the ability to assemble weapons. This is the single-most innovative design choice that Lies of P offers. Every weapon comes in two distinct parts, the blade tip and the handle. Each part has their respective stats; however, you can alter the handle to scale off of different stats than the ones it drops with. This opens up a lot of customization and encourages player experimentation, because at no extra-cost, your entire moveset and ability options can change in a matter of seconds. I myself am a Guts sword girl through and through, but even I felt compelled to experiment and eventually beat the game with my own ridiculous combinations. (Note: For me, this self-expression was VERY important in my enjoyment of the game, and I think it's a great innovation to the souls combat formula to allow your players to test out ANY weapon handle's moveset with... every other weapon's blade. Admittedly boss weapons are restricted from being customized and the scaling of both parts' stab/slash stat means that your options for good damage are inherently limited, but it offers so much freedom regardless that I would not mind seeing it return in the sequel.) 

     Story is the point I want to end this off on. For as long as I have cherished Bloodborne's lore, the original trilogy's lore, etc. I have never actually felt connected to the events of the stories presented in souls-like games. There's always been a strange disconnect for me being able to enjoy the challenge of the gameplay rather than caring about the story. I can say Lies of P genuinely moved me in a way no other games in this subgenre have. I believe the most obvious explanation for this is the greater emphasis on dialogue and player onboarding that Lies of P engages in. There is a real sense here with the amount of dialogue you'll receive from a character off-screen during gameplay or in the middle of a boss fight that Neowiz really wanted to make players feel INVOLVED in the big character moments as they are happening, rather than reading about them from a lore description (which is also a method of storytelling present with a lot to read up on that is engaging.) To be clear, I have no issue with this, but I really prefer the focus on character engaging with me, the truths/lies you decide to tell them, and the almost-immediate consequences those decisions can have as they relay their reactions back to you. You can ignore or fight multiple bosses by making a simple decision. I like that. The narrative throughline that is happening above all of the character stories is decently executed, but the character quests is really where Lies of P shines (shoutout to Arlecchino.) Everyone is voice acted phenomenally, and this could not be a Lies of P review without making mention of how pivotal this game's original soundtrack is to the overall experience. The music feels tied to the characters' stories, as many records you can play back at Hotel Krat are received from quest completions. This makes even something as seemingly trivial as playing a record on a record player feel rewarding in itself, as you learn more about an NPC's journey through this world or simply enjoy a great tune in the background. 

     This has become my comfort game, and affectionately so. That doesn't mean it is devoid of things I disliked, as the final area of the game, Arche Abbey, has got to be the single-most tedious level I have played in recent memory. Running through this moody grey wasteland to a grey tower with grey floors and repeated enemies from throughout the entire game got tiring incredibly fast, and it's a shame that the area with this game's pinnacle challenges is also so uninspired in its design. Additionally, I do not think the armor system, dubbed ""Defense parts,"" is particularly exciting. I think this could be fleshed out a little more, but finding more parts throughout the game is almost never exciting because they are always going to be better than your previous find, and they do not change any part of your puppet's appearance. I do like the cosmetics available here, but I definitely prefer the more free-form style of armor expression in other souls-likes. The legion arm system is probably the most disappointing aspect for me, delivering options to customize your limb similar to the prosthetic tools in Sekiro. I do not like the implementation in this game because it feels stiff to me. This is not something I have the knowledge to explain away, but it feels very restricted and with the low amount of legion I always have, it just left a lot to be desired for me because I mainly relied on parrying and counterattacking. 

     Despite my negatives, I adore this game. At the time of writing I have unlocked everything pre-DLC and waiting in anticipation for it as well as the recently announced sequel. If you've ever got a weekend to knockout a surprisingly compelling souls-like, this is absolutely the one for you.",True,english

It also looks great and runs smoothly. Even on the Steam Deck with decent graphic settings, I was easily keeping 60 FPS.

Some people have criticized it for not being as open world as a game like Elden Ring, but I see that as a positive aspect of Lies of P. Being able to have a more linear path made the gameplay tight and paced well. It also never felt like it overstayed it's welcome, like I wind up feeling about many open world games.

The story telling itself is great. GoW 2018, compared to Ragnarök, felt more ""hopeful"" and positive in a way, whilst Ragnarök setting feels like desperation and end of times (as it should tho). Great work of Santa Monica Studio.

Spoiler [spoiler] Not a fan playing as Atreus. He's got great moves and fun combat, but the Ironwood level was too long and boring in most parts. [/spoiler]

Not going into the PSN thing; It sucks, but I knew it was a requirement going into it.

Will update if something major changes, but if you are holding out because of sporadic reports of performance issues at 1440p on an 8 gig card, they are either sorted out (patch 2) or were due to other factors (out-of-date drivers, etc).

I'm recommending and warning you against buying this game at the same time.

You have the problems - the game's approach to puzzles is literally insulting to your intelligence. Every time you encounter a puzzle, the companion you're with tells you how to solve it before you even have a chance to take a look around. ""Hey, maybe that thing above you is gonna open a pathway"" and that's literally every puzzle in the game. This should be an accessibility option, you should be able to shut your companions up when you're trying to solve the already trivial puzzles. Sure the combat is still nice, story is nice, but this? Its insulting. Not a single puzzle goes without your companion telling you exactly how to solve it. ""Woow, what if we freeze this?"" and the moment you try anything, they will say something like ""oh no maybe lets try something else"" or ""oh yes we did it"" to indicate the correct solution which they already gave to you to begin with.

LOOK HERE    ---->    The PSN drama isn't as bad here as it was with helldivers, since in helldivers you could buy and play the game for like 3 months before they made it impossible to play for some regions. Here on the other hand you had warnings of the PSN requirement from the very start. Is it okay to have mandatory PSN requirements for a PC version of a single player game? 
Definitely a garbage decision which is clearly one of the biggest flaws of the newer games to come out. Some regions will require you to link a phone number to check your age, I think it is the case for the UK. The other ones will ask for your postal code and real name - it's all going to a third party website which is KNOWN for losing your data to frequent data leaks and hacks. Obviously PSN doesn't care whether you own or even intend to own a PS5 for this, you still need the account because they want to collect more data, it's as simple as this.

Having said that, I think the game itself is great, the unlocked framerate makes it even smoother to play to be honest. Then on the other hand, if you're not okay with this invasion on your personal data security, maybe rethink purchasing it. Same applies to some specific regions of the world which require even more data than other regions. I really suggest you look it up before you buy the game.

TLDR: PSN bad, game doesn't respect your intelligence with insane amounts of handholding but good story and good gameplay overall. Not goty but buy this if you can overlook the PSN drama.",True,english

Beyond well optimized. Its easily one of my favorite games to play right now.

Aside from running well, this game has been everything I wanted it to be and then some. Compared to the vibe of original FF7, I think this does it a lot of justice. The characters and dialogue are fun, the Shinra menace is equally pronounced etc.

The combat is so smooth I don't even know where to start. But somehow they made a turn-based FF game feel completely naturally FF in an action RPG environment. It's great.

The pacing is good, the side quests are cute and rewarding. I feel like I wasn't wasting much time if any in this game. Everything just sorta flows when you figure out the map.

I can praise this game all day. I'm on the last chapter as of today - I only have a few issues:

-The humor can be out of place sometimes along with the fan service. Particularly when you hear Tifa say 'Man I really need a shower' for the 40th time after a fight it sorta makes you raise an eyebrow, genuinely. That crap is NOT why I'm here and it's sad to me that these adults designing these games find it adds anything to this kinda game.

-I get there is world building and the game GENUINELY at times feels like a re-imagined PS1 game but at times I feel like I'm running down long hallways for no real reason. Are the narrow passages you have to side-step through like...loading screens? Some places are just too big dude. 

-Collect-a-thon. As much as I like that and enjoy it in FF games, this game goes a little too far with the ground clutter. Way too many boxes to destroy. Personally I prefer ~80% of my items to be bought/earned from fights but I'd reckon 70-80% of your important items are in yellow-lit boxes and the battle rewards are mostly for gil. Is what it is. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I would probably enjoy *an hour or 2* Less destroying boxes on the ground.",True,english

No. However, for this remake, it feels right. Moving onto changes in the story. There are a lot I agree with, and it was nice to have a change. However, I also felt a lot didn't need a change.

- Combat gets interruped every five second because camera gotta zoom on enemy charging attack.
- Knockbacks are insane every time you get close they knock you back and they can lead to combos just becouse.
- Even if you manage to hit enemy they just automatically counter deal damage to you and send you away again.
- Party members are awful they do just bare minimum, they live long enough just becouse enemy mostly targets only character currenty controlled by player.(Also same useless character blows in next cinematic fifty ton boulder with lightning. That just makes me scream.)
- Dodge got no i frames it only avoids aoe and projectiles in melee vs bosses is pretty much useless.
- Attacks cannot be cancelled probably biggest turnback issue i have no idea why but we can only watch next three seconds getting hit and have no other option.
- I did it in second try and the WORST thing is i dont even know how..

Fans of the original will be pleased with just about everything barring the combat, which you'll either love or hate. The move away from turn-based has been divisive amongst FF fans and while I think it's done well sometimes (like here) and done poorly in others (like FF15, which feels clunky and often time tedious), I do still miss it somewhat.

The PC port is quite polished now and supports HDR, so maxed out it looks like how the original FMVs looked in my kid mind playing OG.

Decent amount of replayability to go through hard mode and find other content, but being the first part of a 3-part epic you could breeze through it and be left wanting more.

The game in general feels good, there isn`t as much complexity as FF15 in combat, but a more straight forward approach, something the hardcore FF15 fans may be disappointed by. The story in my eyes, isn`t a 10/10, but it`s enjoyable. Likeable characters, and party members. The dlcs however are lackluster. Echos of the fallen, though it is half the price of The rising tide, it`s just a single dungeon with little to enrich the story further. The rising tide is a step up, and has one of the cooler and more difficult Ifrit fights which is something many should look forward to. 7.5/10

SPOILERS BELOW!!!
For me the ending is what puts this game down. The talk with Jill about the moon, and the constant reminding of don`t go dying on us Clive spoils the ending way too much. Not only that, but I was hoping for a better ending, as this is just the ending of FF15 done all over again. Using the crystal, and vanquishing the darkness or blight which it`s called here. The hero dies alone after saying goodbye to all his loved ones, only that Noctis was reunited with his loved ones when he died. I don`t see why every ending has to be a sad and lonely one for our hero.",True,english

Same experience as it was when I played it on PS5.

Great story, amazing visuals, superb combat, great soundtrack. The quests all build on one another and the side characters and their stories relevance plays into another. Difficulty a bit on the lower side (I died only twice, and that was in the DLC to a superboss), but that can all be enhanced by you as the player. There is a New Game+ and an enhanced mode for challenges if that if your forte.

I'll keep the review short.
Buy the game if you want to kill some monsters, watch a great story unfold, and experiment with crazy abilities. It's not DMC level intensity, it's not Soulslike hard, but it doesn't need to be. I didn't want it to be.

I've waited what felt like ages to play this game from the original awakening trailer in 2020, and learning that then CBUIII (Now known as Creative Studio III) helmed the project had me excited. I knew it would eventually make its way to PC so I patiently bided my time despite its PS exclusive status to start. And now roughly 4 years later all that waiting paid off. Luckily I was able to dodge about 90 percent of spoilers beyond what was shown in the pre-launch trailers and maybe 3 out of context screenshots I saw, and thank god. All I knew is that generally critic reception was good, and sort of like with every new FF game the fanbase was semi-divided. Maybe in part due to the gameplay or personal taste kinda stuff like the story, characters, or setting.

[h2]Game Review/Thoughts[/h2]

16 is not a perfect game, and I understand why it might push certain people away if they have rigid guidelines on what makes a Final Fantasy game to them. But 16 is a Final Fantasy through and though, and is more than deserving of its mainline namesake. If you've played 14 before you'll immediately notice the visual and story motifs used here. It feels like a nice showcase of what CBUIII is capable of with a big budget and collective vision for a single player narrative.

The things it gets right 16 does extremely well. Emotionally wrought Shakespearian-esque storytelling that takes you on a rollercoaster ride. Valisthea while picturesque is an unforgiving world where cruelty knows no bounds. But in the various tragedies and hardships does the 16 writing team showcase the indomitable human spirit, and the will to keep going in the face of adversity. In many ways it reminds me of the best parts of the Hydaelyn/Zodiark saga of 14 encapsulated in single player form by Maehiro, and not just Heavensward. The sidequest stories were also nice besides the given rewards they help immensely with world building, and giving more background to Valisthea's people (Take the time in your own leisure to do these if you haven't, they've made me become more attached to this ""universe"" by doing them). Also Clive is a wonderful leading protagonist whose POV we view the world, and while there's a generally amazing supporting cast you need to know everything in the game is in support of his story. A bold choice, but the right one I believe. 

The combat is fast and frenetic with a lot of room for skill expression for those that seek it despite how basic it might seem. It took me a bit to find a rhythm, but after getting 3 Eikon slots the potential really opens up. Not quite on the level of an actual character action game like DMC/Bayonetta, but enough where dedicated players can do some crazy combos while not taking any damage/parrying their way through battle. To me gameplay wise its a happy medium between ""soulslike"" combat, dynasty warrriors, and a platinum game in one. However for those not good at these types of games playing on story focused mode and using the timely accessories will allow you to get through the game with ease. I played on action focused mode and felt it was fair difficulty. Only 2 bosses towards the end game me a bit of trouble.

The OST showcases Soken's best work to date, and is another reminder to why he's so beloved for those who've experienced his previous arrangements in context. The various themes for the game are beautiful alongside their leitmotifs used in certain situations as well. I especially enjoyed the choral aspects which give certain tracks this either sobering or epic feel. The Titan themes have no business going that hard btw, you'll know what I mean when you get there if you play this lol. Also [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeqyEzK87z4]""Find the Flame"" (Clive's Theme)[/url], [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf3wH29UYi8]""Away"" (Joshua's Theme)[/url], and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlRZi-War2o]""Winter's Bound/My Star"" (Jill's Theme)[/url] are all amazing songs with breathtaking leitmotifs. Nobuo Uematsu will forever be FF's Beethoven and the GOAT, but Soken when he's given the opportunity is like Mozart. Both very different composers on the way they go about things, but should both be respected in their own right.

Lastly before I get to my critiques I'll get to art direction/visuals. While not every texture is rendered/created equal on the whole XVI is a very striking looking game, and really captures that dark western style fantasy look. It feels like Kazuya Takahashi's (Whom I often get confused with Akihiko Yoshida since their art is similar and they have a bit of crossover) impressionism is brought to life. The character designs particularly with the male character's hair is definitely FF lol, but the costumes/clothing seem fitting for the setting of the game. I've also grown to really like the way Clive looks as our protagonist over time. Just all in all great stuff. Different from the more easily recognizable known art work of Tetsuya Nomura, but in a good way. Not everything in Square Enix needs to be designed by that dude as beloved as he is.

[h2]Critiques/Complaints[/h2]

The pacing can at times be iffy, I've read/heard people have this as a major complaint. But I think its overblown and is not as bad as you think. That said I admit parts of the story do feel like it meanders a bit too much, and if you decide to do all the side quests as I in the base game you will feel this in particular. I think the devs could have added an additional difficulty mode on first playthrough that is a bit harder than action focused mode, but maybe not as crazy as Final Fantasy Mode (An additional new game+ difficulty) for those that wanted a more demanding challenge. And without spoilers I felt like the potential for some characters weren't realized with the amount of screen time they got. Gearing/Crafting in this game is pretty basic, like it exists, but is more a means to an end which is a bit of a missed opportunity. Same could be said of what you do in sidequests aside from additional story (Which was good). The world of Valisthea aside from the major interest points was not as exciting to explore unfortunately compared to other FF games. These issues all together prevent me from saying it's a 10/10 masterpiece or anything of that nature. Performance wise this also needs some work, it's playable but SE needs an optimization patch or two. I'm not even sure if I'm CPU or GPU bound at all. Or if it's a denuvo or a .exe priority thing since the microstutters when they happen are bad.

[h2]Conlusion[/h2]

This is the most fun and enjoyment I've gotten from a mainline game in what feels like forever. I think this might be a top-3 FF game for me despite its issues, the whole of 16 was greater than the sum of its parts. The team had a strong vision for what they wanted to make and stuck to it. I highly respect that, and CBUII's strengths are on full display here for all to see as are their weaknesses/limitations. I think everyone should give this a try when they get the chance. Even if you have to wait for it to go on sale. I've yet to dive into the DLC stories, but I will soon and will do separate reviews on them. I clocked in about 57 hours MSQ, clearing the hunt board, and doing all available sidequests. Expect a roughly similar playtime depending on the pace of your play. Did not touch the combat oriented challenge stuff like trials, but maybe one day.

[h1][b]Sidenote:[/b][/h1] The FPS is all over the place and this needs some performance optimization patches, I hope SE will do it. Otherwise I recommend these mods to help out with framerate issues and whatnot.

This Final Fantasy is a more linear one which is not bad after we had 15 as an open world and XIII kinda open world with sometimes linear parts. 
The story is also interesting and the combat is so good, I love that they asked the combat designer of Devil May Cry to help in this game and it shows. 
No cluster f*ck of a combat like in 15 and the combat feels very fun getting to LIMIT BREAK faster with dodging and abilities.

The only bad point in my eyes in NVIDIA ruining this game for people with even one gen older than their 40 series. 

A ryzen 7 5800 X3D and a 3080 with 32 Gb RAM in the hands of an IT should be sufficient to run this game, even 15 looked better than this now, but why would you ask?
Ngreedia nerfing the 30 series with ""not being able to run''  frame generation, trust me it can do that they just sold too few so they want us to upgrade. 
The card wasn't even using 100 percent of the core die, I got stuck at 85% usage on my 3080 at 1440p. I got a 320 bit bus which 40 series got nerfed in and still got locked software wise.

So I fiddled with some settings and came to the conclusion that 1:
-Nvidia will not be my next brand for a GFX card 
2:
-AMD had to f*cking help me get more frames. 

If you have some trouble with a 3080 try this trick:
Put FSR3 on, put upscaling to Quality and AMD FSR Frame generation on and you will see a big increase, yes on a 3080 we need to use AMD software, Nvidia just nerfed us software wise. 

Then close the game and do this:

Go to %AppData% with the win+R then go back to Local and then to SquareEnix FINAL FANTASY XVI and fully delete the file called ""ffxvi_b96bc3fb.psol"" Start the game again, and enjoy the frames Ngreedia stole from you,

The game is limited to first person, which I didn't mind after awhile. It's an FPS after all. 
Overall, I loved the high octane, high stakes approach it takes to its combat.

I did not play this game when it first launched, so I have no idea what issues from release still remain. I can however report on the problems I did find regularly:
- Poor LOD Rendering
There were many times, particularly after installing the Phantom Liberty DLC, where the game's engine struggled a lot with loading LODs properly. I mainly noticed it with the NPCs and vehicles, especially when driving, where they would load at very low detail until you're like a few steps away. Rarely when driving, the road can just unload for some reason and become invisible for a couple seconds, which can really screw with you. This is pretty uncommon though.
- Low Traffic Density While Driving
When you're not driving around the city, the traffic is pretty normal. However, once you start going at high speeds on the road, traffic seems to diminish significantly. This does create an uncanny result considering its supposed to be a mega city. It seems the game does this to further save on resources, but it is still somewhat distracting how little traffic there can be.
- Vehicle Summoning
The game allows you to call your vehicle, and it will drive itself to you. Even to this day, the menu for this still says the feature is in beta. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any plans to properly finish it. Now, I bring this up because a lot of the time, the place that it chooses to spawn your car is..not great. Sometimes it will spawn on another road that's like a block away, and other times it spawns it in other vehicles. But on occasion, the car may straight up spawn in the air, where you can watch it gracefully tumble all the way to the ground. Other than traditional fast travel, cars and motorcycles are the de facto way to get around Night City, so a feature like this should probably have had more time in the oven.

Despite those recurring issues I had, they are nowhere near game breaking. They only hurt the already amazing immersion a bit. I did not really experience any crashes before installing mods, so those issues seem to be gone. In all, I definitely think the game is in a good place now. If you were thinking about getting Cyberpunk for yourself, I highly recommend it.",True,english

All the RPG elements you'd expect, fully voiced, great post-release maintenance/commitment and in a truly interesting non-fanstasy setting. The mechanics don't really mirror Cyberpunk 2020 or Cyberpunk: RED TTRPGs; while unfortunate, the mechanics in this game are solid.

And best of all, the game very moddable with a vibrant, engaged, and productive mod community.

Only disappointing aspect was that it has no 3rd person. You cannot see the character of the story, you cannot see their cool moves and action. Rather it's like you, the player at the computer, is there rather than the character of the story. And it wasn't immediately apparent how this weakens the whole experience.

But other than that there are only two minor points of weakness, both addressable in the mature product:
1. Boss fights assume certain style of play--the dev's preference. This is solvable by mods.
2. CDPR having their favorite story ending and putting weak effort into other endings because you should have thought like the devs and writers to get the best endgame experience [see Witcher 3]. This is solvable by research and then playing the fleshed out single ending CDPR envisioned.

Everything else is top notch, engaging, and fun. Has all the RPG elements you'd expect and good quests, decent story lines. DLC is lacking, but they did release one at least--it's also very decent; almost more interesting than the main storyline [again, see Witcher 3].

The World of Cyberpunk 2077 is a dark and gritty one. A dystopian but but also real future where you're either rich or barely surviving. but what makes this game beautiful is, despite it all, you keep fighting for a better life, never fully loosing hope even at your lowest of lows. the game shows this with not only your character but also the supporting cast. Characters who often seem hard and tuff like the city has forced them to be opening up to you and being vurnurable to you as you get to know them. Judy, Panam, heck even Johnny Silverhand. all characters who I will remember and cherish.

Now as to the gameplay when this game first came out it was, and I pardon my language, Dogshit... But ever since the 2.0 update they overhauled everything and somehow did a complete 180! With the gunplay going from feeling unimpactful and bland to OOMPHY in the best way possible and then the upgrade system acually feeling worth it with new abilities and customization to make truly unique and fun builds all of which are viable! I personaly love fully upgrading reflexes allowing me to dash and dodge around both on ground and mid-air for some really fun almost bullethell like movement or going for a more stealth build allowing you to quickly take out enemy bases and finish gigs with a quick swipe reall assassin style! just a few of the many ways to play the game and I can practically garantee that there is a playstyle for you! So much fun.

The music is also amazing and somethign I wanna highlight as a producer myself. It really perfected what Cyberpunk should sound like. It's drone like nature with these elements of punk music really fusing together in such a unique way! It just has this tensity to it that just feels suspenseful. Then there's the action music which I swear I would be so much stealthier if it didn't go as hard as it goes cuz DAMN it makes me pumped! It's so intense and adrenaline filled and fits so well to every senario! truly spectacular.
but the best tracks in the game for me are the more quiet ones. the ones that play in somber or joyful moments. the themes of the characters you meet. Johnnys theme using a cello/violin making it sound like a guitar somehow is just beautiful and really shows another side of johnny in a way. and leidmotives of ""never fade away"" (a song by Johnnys band) playing at just the right times making it almost a theme of sorts for the events that it plays in. I dunno It just adds so much to the imersion and I can't get enough of it.

And don't even get me started on the DLC. Phantom Liberty is one of the best expansions I have ever played. The district of Dogtown is dense and full of fun activities to do, but once again the highlights are the characters. Somehow they're even deeper than before, feeling like acual people who all have unique motives and personalities that when it came time to choose I couldn't decide cuz I cared so much for all of them. I wanted the best for all of them but due to the nature of the story (which i won't spoil) I could'nt and it was heartbreaking, but it also felt beautiful in a way. Just absolutly phenomenal story telling and a story I will never forget.

In the end I would personally highly recommend this game. It's a game I always come back to replay, a world that I can't get enough of and one of those games that gave me something I'll keep for the rest of my life. It might take some time to get into but trust me once ur in it will be an experience you will never forget. an experience that, despite it's dark nature, made me feel hope. A thing of beauty for sure.

and a thing of beauty will never fade away...
Keep fighting",True,english

The main story is staged in Night City, an open-world sandbox with a mix of neo-noir and ganster movie characters and narratives. While the DLC's is significantly smaller in scope, it's a tight, well written spy thriller that keeps some of the same beats (the heist elements) but remains fresh with new stakes and an interesting cast.
The RPG is well implemented: in addition to ""cyberware"" -interchangeable parts that influence your controls, movements patterns, weapon affinity and some gameplay interactions, you have 3 main variables that make for very deep character building: Attributes, Perks and Skills.
You have 5 main Attributes- each Attributes will have its own ""Perk"" tree. Raising an Attribute (up to a max of 20) will unlock more (and better) Perks. Attributes mostly have an influence on weapon proficiency and some interactions, but will also impact how you approach certain missions. Will you break the door? Can you hack the door? Can you stay hidden or will you ram through? The 3D environment of Night City helps you tackle situations with a wide variety of possible solutions.
While the ""Attributes"" can only be reset once per game, the Perks can be refunded and distributed again as many times as you wish outside combat, encouraging experimentation. You can see which weapons work best for you, how your perks interact with each other and your cybernetic implants.
The Skills progress naturally- anytime you perform an action, take down an enemy with a certain weapon, pass a dialogue or Attribute check- the related Skill will increase. Up to a max of 50, every 5 levels you will unlock a permanent boost.

I think the main downside to the game is how long it is- not all missions are created equal and sometimes it's a drag or a bit of a bore, but those moments are few and sandwiched between thrilling combat sequence. Didn't particularly care for the DB elements either.

Overall 9/10, the few narrative lapses or repetitive nature of some missions didn't spoil my fun enough to bring the score lower than that. I would just add that the soundtrack is a constant banger and is very serviceable to the story.",True,english

After finally folding and purchasing the base game at a discount, I quickly grew to love the combat system, methods of gaining power, and especially the story the game told. The most important part of any game to me is the story, followed by the combat mechanics, then the graphics. Cyberpunk smashed all my expectations so much so that I purchased Phantom Liberty at full price when I was halfway through the game, solely because I knew I wanted more content before the end of the game. I'm very glad I did. The DLC has been wonderful, and without spoiling it, I would rate it 2 tiers above the base game (7/10 - base, 9/10 DlC, for an average of 8/10). Note that 5/10 simply means ""average"" and reasonable for the experience/price. I fully recommend the DLC if you enjoyed the base game.",True,english

1. For some reason, when the chase starts and you get hit by a car and continue driving, we did not continue. Our car got pushed to the gate and didn't move. I had to restart.
2. Then when you start fighting scavs, it's needlessly hard. It's my 2nd playthrough, on hard difficulty. On hard, I killed Adam Smasher on 2nd try at just lvl 35 with sucky cyberware, and I'd say Adam Smasher is one of the hardest bosses in the game. This thing took me 5 tries. My advice -- when you get out of car, you get blades. Forget the blades, get back to pistol, find cover and be very careful as they'll shred you very quickly. Be careful with skulls and netrunners. First time I got killed by a runner.
3. After finally doing this, I go to the ""wounded scav"" and... nothing happens. It's bugged again. Trust me, I tried everything and I don't think I did anything unusual to cause it. 

At this point I just lost it. Come on, The DLC had been out for a year now, and the base game is 4 years old at this point. I understand that making games of this scale is hard.

The dlc is its own thing pretty much with an extra ending of its own, which has the added benefit of skipping the remainder of the core vidya.

Now, onto the good things: the script, the pacing, the dialogues, the execution of a properly polished thriller. The DLC adds some extra missions for old fixers. Fetch quests aside, the quest are good too, adding depth and nuance to the NPCs. Though the most important is the selection of end-game choices you're presented with. Between wetwork, dubious loyalties and complex motivations of dramatis personaes, someone did their homework on intelligence services so a lot of it offers a very authentic experience. A lot of times you leave feeling dirty - because that is the nature of the work. My only criticism is you couldn't off Meyers (it'd be tons of fun, I think), but otherwise it's next to excellent. Johnny's dialogue at the end of the lunar escape was a rare gem, diverging from his usual abrasive rants. Meeting Mr Hands in person was somewhat of a letdown, but more gigs from the sphinxian villain was welcome.

It's difficult to believe the DLC was produced by the same studio as the cliché and filth-filled dumpster fire that is the core game. The setting remains as disgusting as ever, with humanity locked in a dull and primitive state of neo-feudal corporate overlords or communes of plain-roaming barbarians, but Phantom Liberty redeems the price tag. If you find a way to skip to the DLC and just play the extra, do it: it is a real treat for any lovers of a spy drama - something Deux Ex tried and failed to do.

Edit: ending credits animation film was an outstanding tribute to the classic James Bond movies. Stellar.",True,english

Imagine if James Bond, Keanu Reeves, and Idris Elba decided to throw a party in Night City, and you get to clean up the mess. That’s Phantom Liberty for you.

The expansion kicks off with the President of the New United States crash-landing in Dogtown. Yes, you read that right. Apparently, Air Force One now comes with a “crash here for plot development” button. You’re hired to rescue her, but not before you navigate through a maze of cybernetic baddies, morally ambiguous choices, and enough plot twists to make a pretzel jealous.

Idris Elba’s character, Solomon Reed, is the secret agent we all wish we could be. He’s suave, he’s mysterious, and he probably has a better skincare routine than you. Meanwhile, Keanu Reeves returns as Johnny Silverhand, still rocking that “I hate the system” vibe but with a touch more existential dread. It’s like watching your cool uncle go through a mid-life crisis, but with more explosions.

Dogtown itself is a marvel. It’s like someone took all the worst parts of a dystopian future and decided to make it a tourist attraction. The local wildlife includes cyber-enhanced gangsters and vending machines that might just try to sell you a grenade. But hey, at least the street food is to die for—literally.

The gameplay is a rollercoaster of emotions. One moment you’re making life-or-death decisions, the next you’re wondering why your character’s pants have suddenly disappeared. It’s all part of the Cyberpunk experience, folks. Embrace the chaos.

In conclusion, Phantom Liberty is the perfect blend of high-stakes drama, cybernetic mayhem, and unintentional comedy. It’s like a soap opera set in a dystopian future, and honestly, we wouldn’t have it any other way. So, grab your cyberdeck, put on your best trench coat, and dive into the madness. Just watch out for those vending machines.",True,english

I'm recommending and warning you against buying this game at the same time.

You have the problems - the game's approach to puzzles is literally insulting to your intelligence. Every time you encounter a puzzle, the companion you're with tells you how to solve it before you even have a chance to take a look around. ""Hey, maybe that thing above you is gonna open a pathway"" and that's literally every puzzle in the game. This should be an accessibility option, you should be able to shut your companions up when you're trying to solve the already trivial puzzles. Sure the combat is still nice, story is nice, but this? Its insulting. Not a single puzzle goes without your companion telling you exactly how to solve it. ""Woow, what if we freeze this?"" and the moment you try anything, they will say something like ""oh no maybe lets try something else"" or ""oh yes we did it"" to indicate the correct solution which they already gave to you to begin with.

LOOK HERE    ---->    The PSN drama isn't as bad here as it was with helldivers, since in helldivers you could buy and play the game for like 3 months before they made it impossible to play for some regions. Here on the other hand you had warnings of the PSN requirement from the very start. Is it okay to have mandatory PSN requirements for a PC version of a single player game? 
Definitely a garbage decision which is clearly one of the biggest flaws of the newer games to come out. Some regions will require you to link a phone number to check your age, I think it is the case for the UK. The other ones will ask for your postal code and real name - it's all going to a third party website which is KNOWN for losing your data to frequent data leaks and hacks. Obviously PSN doesn't care whether you own or even intend to own a PS5 for this, you still need the account because they want to collect more data, it's as simple as this.

Having said that, I think the game itself is great, the unlocked framerate makes it even smoother to play to be honest. Then on the other hand, if you're not okay with this invasion on your personal data security, maybe rethink purchasing it. Same applies to some specific regions of the world which require even more data than other regions. I really suggest you look it up before you buy the game.

TLDR: PSN bad, game doesn't respect your intelligence with insane amounts of handholding but good story and good gameplay overall. Not goty but buy this if you can overlook the PSN drama.",True,english

Despite the fictional backdrop of a zombie apocalypse, Project Zomboid nails realism in almost every aspect of gameplay. The most valuable tip for any new player is simply: ""What would you do in this situation?"" The game's health system is intricate, with injuries, illnesses, and mental states all playing a role. Clothes protect you from zombie bites, degrade over time, and help regulate body temperature, which is vital. Mechanics like repairing vehicles, dealing with character traits and professions, and managing inventory weight make everything feel real. I especially love how character emotions and moods affect gameplay – it’s small touches like these that elevate Project Zomboid to another level of immersion.

2. An Open World That Never Ends
The current game world is massive, and despite having played over 730 hours, I still didn't explore all the areas. I admire the sheer size of the map, and with upcoming updates promising to expand it further and even include randomly generated maps in the distant future. Project Zomboid also offers infinite gameplay and replayability. It’s one of those survival games you can play over and over without ever getting tired.

3. Sandbox Customization Options
One of my favorite aspects is the ability to tailor the world to your liking. From the number and behavior of zombies to loot distribution, characters (players), and more, Project Zomboid lets you tweak almost anything. It gives you the power to create a world that fits your personal playstyle or challenge yourself with tougher scenarios.

4. Character Creation and Professions
This is hands-down one of my favorite features in the game. Choosing different professions and character traits, both positive and negative, significantly changes how the game plays. I also appreciate the subtle bonuses and drawbacks that aren’t immediately obvious – it adds an extra layer of depth. The balance in this system is present, too, so don’t expect to create an overpowered character unless you tweak the sandbox settings to do so!

5. Community Mods
While Project Zomboid doesn’t need mods to be great, the fact that they’re available is a huge bonus. The modding community has added incredible content, from enhanced realism to new vehicles, traits, weapons, and crafting options. There’s too much to describe in one review! That said, I recommend playing without mods at first to truly grasp the game’s mechanics, but later on, mods can make the experience even better.

6. Skill Levels and Physical Attributes
Project Zomboid features an extensive skill system that allows players to improve their characters through practice and experience. Skills are divided into categories like combat, crafting, survival, and agility, each having a noticeable impact on gameplay. Combat skills such as aiming and reloading become crucial for firearm users, while melee skills like blunt and blade proficiency determine how effective you are with weapons like baseball bats or axes. Crafting skills, including carpentry, metalworking, and tailoring, let you fortify your base, repair clothes, or even create tools from scratch.
Survival skills like foraging and fishing allow you to live off the land when resources run dry, and farming lets you grow your own food, providing a sustainable source of nutrition. Agility skills, such as sneaking and lightfooted, are essential for staying hidden from zombies, while sprinting helps you escape when the situation gets dire.
Physical attributes like strength and fitness are equally important, as they directly affect how much weight you can carry, how fast you tire, and how effective you are in combat. Improving your strength means you can carry heavier loads and hit harder with melee attacks, while better fitness ensures you can run longer distances and recover faster from exhaustion. Each skill progresses the more you use it, making every action in the game feel meaningful and rewarding.

7. Intriguing (But Optional) Lore
While the storyline isn’t central to the player’s experience yet, it does exist, and it’s fascinating. I only started diving into the game’s lore after playing for about 500 hours, and once I did, I was hooked. I went so far as to read up on the game’s backstory online (beware of spoilers!) Exploring the lore adds a new dimension to the game. I highly recommend getting to know the lore yourself!

8. A Sandbox Experience
Want to build? Build. Want to destroy? Go ahead. In Project Zomboid, your creativity (and characters human possibilities) are your only limits. The only challenge is gathering materials, which makes sense given the post-apocalyptic setting. But with enough time and motivation, you can accomplish incredible things. This open-ended approach is perfect for players who enjoy creating and building their own worlds.

9. Active Developer Support
The game is still in early access, and while it may not be updated on a daily basis, the developers deliver large, meaningful updates. They listen to player feedback, fix bugs, and continue to improve the game without ignoring the community, which is something I greatly respect.

10. Hidden Depths
Just when you think you’ve learned everything there is to know about Project Zomboid, it surprises you. The game is full of hidden mechanics and features that add to the depth of the experience. I’ve had several moments where I thought I had mastered the game, only to discover a new layer of complexity. It’s a game that keeps on giving.

11. Fair Price
Finally, let’s talk about the price. For what Project Zomboid offers, the price is perfect. But if you’re looking to save a bit of money, it’s always worth waiting for a sale. Either way, you’re getting your money’s worth for this gem of a game.

Project Zomboid is a truly exceptional survival game that combines deep realism with sandbox freedom. Whether you're fighting off zombies, building your own fortress, or scavenging for supplies, every moment feels impactful. With continuous updates, an active modding community, and endless replayability, it’s a game that will keep you coming back for more. I can’t recommend it highly enough to fans of survival games or anyone looking for a challenging, immersive experience.",True,english

Online play in a mixed bag depending on what character you main but that is mostly skill issue. Modern controls and dynamic are good additions to those who need it; me personally i use classic because i like the option of having a full move-set. World tour is a decent length and is a great way to learn characters progressively and exploring your play style. I recommend playing simple characters first if you are an absolute beginner and learn terminology as you play. Putting a good amount of time in training mode will benefit greatly and help you figure out routes and combos.

Since Street fighter 5, the graphics gotten better while some character designs gone deformed mutations. The game is fun to play with friends and all, but what happened to the body/limbs ratios? The costumes are so expensive, the hub is a chore for people wanting to play a game since the damn get disconnected for no reason. The world tour is more interesting to play then the other 2 modes, Fighting Ground and the Hub. Good game to play till the freshness go stale. Personally I feel Alpha series and Street fighter 4(s) fans may want skip this while those liked SF3 and 5 could or may like this. Go try playing with someone with the game not the demo and you might see where I'm going about. This is a fighting game that doesn't really want be one.

""What else can they possibly add?"" I thought. But after a few hours in the game, my skepticism vanished like sand in the arena. Capcom clearly knew what they were doing, and they did it damn well!

Pros
Graphics and Animation ""Street Fighter 6"" is one of those games you turn on just to admire the visual beauty. The animations are smooth and detailed, so every Hadouken feels like it’s hitting you right in the gut. The character designs are stunning, especially the female fighters—body physics are really on point here! The movement dynamics and natural forms are simply breathtaking. And Zangief... well, Zangief is like a walking bodybuilding simulator. With muscles like those, how can you not love the guy?

Variety of Characters The game has everything you need for a perfect fighting experience. Say hello to old favorites like Ryu and Chun-Li, now with new tricks up their sleeves. Plus, there are new fighters that are so cool, even Dhalsim would say, ""Now that’s real yoga!"" Every character is a unique universe with special moves that you can spend hours mastering. And while you're honing your skills with Cammy, just remember: don’t be that guy who forgets to block.

Gameplay and Mechanics If you thought you knew everything about combos, ""Street Fighter 6"" will show you just how wrong you were. New mechanics like the Drive Gauge add even more depth and strategy to the game. The gameplay is so smooth and diverse that every match feels like a true art form. And yes, you could watch Zangief spin around with an opponent in a grapple for hours—it's like a physics lesson from a tough Siberian teacher!

Online Mode Finally, you can fight your friends online without the fear of being kicked out of the match at a crucial moment! The online mode is much more stable, and the variety of competitive matches available now is almost endless. And how can you not laugh when your friend tries to pull off a Shoryuken but accidentally ends up doing a Hadouken instead? Moments like these are what make the game even more fun.

Music and Sound The soundtrack is pure power. You just can't stay still when these tracks are playing. The music amps up the adrenaline during fights, and the sound effects are so intense that every hit feels physical. If Zangief heard this music in real life, he’d probably start doing squats with a bear on his shoulders.

Cons
Excessive Difficulty If you’re new to the series, brace yourself: ""Street Fighter 6"" will beat you up like a training dummy set to max difficulty. The new mechanics aren’t as easy to master as they seem at first glance. Sometimes it feels like you're fighting not a bot, but a pro player who’s got their brain wired directly into the game.

Microtransactions Yep, Capcom decided we could use a little extra spending. While these don’t affect the balance of fights, the ability to buy additional cosmetic items with real money can be a bit annoying. Sure, you could spend a couple of dozen hours fighting to earn that new outfit, but who’s got that kind of time?

Character Balance There are times when you feel like you’re just being swept off the arena with no chance of winning. Some characters clearly need a bit of balancing, otherwise they just dominate in battles. Hopefully, the devs will notice this and fix it in future updates.

Conclusion
""Street Fighter 6"" isn’t just a game; it’s a true celebration for all fighting game fans. The new mechanics, awesome characters, and incredible physics make this a must-play for anyone who loves the genre. Sure, there are a few rough edges, but if you’re up for the challenge, ""Street Fighter 6"" is waiting with open arms and ready for a fight.

From the moment you shrink down to the size of an ant and step into the backyard, you’re immersed in a beautifully crafted environment that feels both familiar and fantastical. Every blade of grass towers like a tree, every droplet of water shimmers with detail, and every tiny pebble feels like a boulder—Grounded transforms the mundane into something magical.

The art style is where this game truly shines. The bright, vibrant colors bring the backyard to life, giving it a playful and inviting feel. Despite the dangers that lurk in the grass, there's an undeniable warmth to the world that makes exploration feel rewarding. It captures the essence of being a kid again—where everything feels larger than life, full of wonder and possibility. The way the sunlight filters through leaves, the texture of a dandelion puff, and the glistening of dew drops all add to the sense that you’re in a living, breathing micro-ecosystem.

The attention to detail is remarkable. Each insect is brought to life with such care, from the twitching antennae of ants to the translucent wings of ladybugs. These creatures move and behave in a way that makes the world feel alive, and interacting with them is both thrilling and enchanting. There’s something incredibly charming about watching a line of ants march off with crumbs of food or hearing the distant chirping of crickets as night falls.

Even in moments of danger, when a wolf spider comes charging out of the undergrowth or a bombardier beetle sprays its acid, the art style retains a sense of wonder. It’s a perfect blend of cute and creepy, striking a balance that keeps you invested without losing the game's whimsical tone.

The overall aesthetic of Grounded makes it feel like a love letter to adventure and curiosity, capturing that childhood sense of exploration where every corner of the yard feels like a brand-new world to discover. It’s a game that invites you to slow down, look around, and appreciate the beauty in the little things.

If you're looking for a survival game that offers more than just crafting and combat, Grounded stands out with its charming art style and world design. It’s a delightful experience that turns a simple backyard into a vibrant, awe-inspiring adventure playground. Whether you’re playing solo or with friends, you’ll find yourself constantly amazed at how enchanting the tiniest details can be.",True,english

- Raft
- Subnautica 
- Project Zomboid 

but this game has opened a new calm for me. I love my little critter friends (even tho in real life I hate all critters), the Spider mode makes the spiders funny little floating blobs and the story is really cool! I just wish you could ride the lady bugs because that would be really cool! 

10/10 would recommend.",True,english
